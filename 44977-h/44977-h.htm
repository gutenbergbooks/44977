  <p class="ph3">THE RIGHT HONOURABLE W. EWART GLADSTONE, M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</span><br />
</p>

<p>I had the honour to place in your hands the complete Poems of <span class="smcap">Sir
John Davies</span> in the Fuller Worthies' Library. In now publishing
these Poems for a wider circle of readers and students, I re-dedicate
them to you.</p>

<p>That I should have wished (and wish) to inscribe the Works of a man
famous as a prescient and practical Statesman, as a philosophic
Thinker, as an Orator, as a Lawyer, and as a Poet, to you, is
extremely natural; for in you, Sir,&mdash;in common with all Great Britain
and Europe, and America,&mdash;I recognize his equal, and England's
foremost living name, in nearly every department wherein the elder
distinguished himself; while transfiguring and ennobling all, is
your conscience-ruled and stainless Christian life. That you gave me
permission so to do, with appreciative and kindly words, adds to my
pleasure. Trusting that my fresh 'labour of love' (for which 'love of
labour' has been necessary) on this Worthy may meet your continued
approval,</p>

<p class="center">
I am, Sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With high regard and gratitude,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yours faithfully and truly,</span><br />

<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"><i>Preface.</i></a></h2>


<p>My edition of the Complete Poems of Sir John Davies in the Fuller
Worthies' Library in 1869; since being followed up with a similarly
complete collection of his much more extensive Prose, as Volumes II.
and III. of his entire Works&mdash;met with so instant a Welcome, that very
speedily I had to return the answer of 'out of print' to numerous
applicants. Accordingly it was with no common satisfaction I agreed
to the request of the Publishers that Sir John Davies' complete Poems
should succeed Giles Fletcher's in their Early English Poets.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this new edition I have carefully re-collated
the whole of the original and early editions, with the same advantage
and for the same reasons, as in Giles Fletcher's. I have likewise been
enabled to make some interesting additions, as will appear in the
respective places.</p>

<p>I wish very cordially to re-thank various friends for their continued
helpfulness. Several I must specify: To Dr. Brinsley Nicholson I
am indebted for many suggestions, and spontaneous research towards
elucidating the Poems. I would specially thank B. H. Beedham, Esq.,
Ashfield House, Kimbolton, for not only making a transcript of the
holograph copy of the "Twelve Wonders" in Downing College Library,
Cambridge, and of the Lines to the King in All Souls' College,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
Oxford&mdash;both Colleges readily allowing this&mdash;but for his old-fashioned
enthusiasm and carefulness of scrutiny of every available source, far
and near. Biographical results will be utilized more fully elsewhere,
viz. in the Memorial-Introduction to be prefixed to the Prose in the
complete Works; but meantime and here I cannot sufficiently acknowledge
Mr. Beedham's kindness or my obligation to him. To Colonel Chester, of
Bermondsey, for ready and most useful help in family-Wills, &amp;c., I am
as often deeply obliged. His Grace the Duke of Northumberland, was good
enough to allow me the leisurely use of his MS. of "Nosce Teipsum" at
Alnwick Castle. Dr. David Laing, of Edinburgh, again entrusted me his
Davies MSS. (See Note, Vol. II., p. 119.)</p>

<p>The Poetry of Sir John Davies, weighty and imperishable though it be,
bears so small a proportion to his entire works and activities in many
departments, that it would be out of keeping to give a lengthened Life
herein. Still, in the present Memorial-Introduction will be found
very much more of accurate detail than hitherto, and corrections of
long-transmitted and accepted mistakes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p>

<p>The discovery of extremely important MSS.&mdash;including State-Papers,
and official and private Letters&mdash;in H.M. Public Record Office, the
Bodleian, Oxford, the British Museum, etc., delays my completion of
the Prose Works and the full Life; but within this year it is my hope
and expectation to issue the whole to my constituents of the Fuller
Worthies' Library. <i>En passant</i>&mdash;for the sake of others it may be
stated that the complete Works (Verse and Prose: 3 vols.) will be
readily accessible in all the leading public Libraries of the Kingdom,
and of the United States.</p>

<p>I send forth this new edition of a great Poet assured that he has not
yet gathered half his destined renown:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="Memorial-Introduction" id="Memorial-Introduction"><i>Memorial-Introduction.</i></a></h2>

<p class="ph3">I. BIOGRAPHICAL.</p>


<p>As in other instances, the first thing to be done in any Life of our
present Worthy, is to distinguish him from other two contemporary Sir
John Davieses&mdash;non-attention to which has in many biographical and
bibliographical works led to no little confusion. There was</p>

<p>I. Sir John Davis (or Davys or Davies) of Pangbourne, Berkshire,
who 'sleeps well' under a chalk-stone monument in the parish church
there. He was mixed up with the 'Plots' (alleged and semi-real),
of the Elizabethan-Essex period. Many of his Letters&mdash;various very
long and matterful and pathetic&mdash;are preserved at Hatfield among the
Cecil-Salisbury MSS. The Blue-Book report of the "Royal Commission on
Historical Manuscripts" (3rd, 1872), makes a strange jumble of our Sir
John and this Sir John's Letters (see Index, s. n.). He was Master
of the Ordnance 31st January, 1598, and was knighted at Dublin 12th
July, 1599. His Will is dated 6th April, 1625, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> proved at
London ... May, 1626. Our Sir John was appointed one of his executors.
Arms: <i>Sable</i>, a griffin, segt., <i>or.</i> He is supposed to have been of
Shropshire descent.</p>

<p>II. Sir John Davies (or Davys or Davis) Knight-Marshal of Connaught and
Thomond: temp. Elizabeth. He had large grants of lands in Roscommon.
He is now represented by the family of Clonshanville (or Loyle) in
Roscommon, who are of Shropshire descent (see Archdall's Peerage of
Ireland.) His Will is dated 14th February, 1625. He died 13th April,
1626. His Will was not proved (at Dublin) until 17th November, 1628.
Arms: Sable, on a chevron, argent, three trefoils slipped, <i>vert.</i>:
crest; a dragon's head erased, <i>vert.</i></p>

<p>According to Mr. J. Payne Collier, the following entry is found in the
register of S. Mary, Aldermanbury: "Buried Sir John Davyes, Knight, May
28, 1624." (Bibliographical Account of Early English Literature, i.,
193). If there be no mistake here, we have another contemporary Sir
John Davies. Certainly it was not ours, and as certainly neither of the
two preceding.[1] </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>The spelling of the family name, which is now Davies, varies very much.
I have found it as Dyve, Dayves, Davyes, Dauis, Davis, and Davies.
Usually our Worthy signs 'Dauyes;' but in his books changes, e.g., in
'Nosce Teipsum' of 1599, to the verse-dedication to Elizabeth, it is
'Dauies;' in 1602 'Dauys,' and in 1608 'Davis,' and so diversely in his
Prose.</p>

<p>Among the Carte Papers in the Bodleian are rough jottings by the
Historian for a Memoir of our Sir John Davies, wherein it is stated
that the family came originally from South Wales to Tisbury, Wiltshire.
The words are: "His family had continued several generations in y<sup>e</sup>
place, though descended from a family of that name in South Wales: but
planted heere in England Temp. Hen. 7: accompanying at that time y<sup>e</sup>
Earle of Pembrooke out of Wales.[2]</p>

<p>The 'estate' of the Davieses at Tisbury was named Chicksgrove
(sometimes spelled Chisgrove.) Only a small fragment of the Manor-house
remains "unto this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> day." The Tisbury parish registers, however, yield
abundant entries of the family-names under the wonted three-fold
'Baptisms,' 'Marriages,' 'Burials;' and the church itself, in tablets
and communion plate, and other memorials, possesses various evidences
of their influential position for many generations, and in many lines
of descent and local intermarriage. It must suffice here briefly to
summarize the Pedigree, and to extract the entries immediately bearing
on our present Life.</p>

<p>Confirming the Carte statement of a Welsh descent, one John Davys, of
... wyn, in Shropshire, temp. Henry VIII., recorded by Carney (1606) in
the Visitation of Dublin in Ulster Office, and according to Chalmers
settled at Tisbury, temp. Edward VI., came from Wales with the Earl
of Pembroke, and was living in 1517 and 1541.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This John Davys
married Matilda, daughter of ... Bridemore, who was buried as "Maud,
Master Davys widow, 18 May, 1570." There was a numerous family of sons
and daughters from this union.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We have only now to do with their
eighth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> and youngest son, John, who was living in 1517 and 1541.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
He was of 'New Inn,' London; and thus, like his more famous son, was
brought up to the study of the Law. This will appear authoritatively
onward; but at this point it is needful to correct and explain a
long-continued error, originated by <span class="smcap">Anthony</span> à-<span class="smcap">Wood</span>
"Athenæ," by Dr. Bliss, Vol. ii., p. 400) apparently, viz. that the
father was "a wealthy tanner," and so Sir John, of "low extraction,"
etc., etc. I do not know that there should have been reason for shame
had the paternal Davies been a 'tanner,' wealthy or otherwise, if
otherwise he was that Christian gentleman which all reports represent.
But the matter-of-fact is that through the premature deaths of his
elder brothers, John Davyes, of Chisgrove, seems to have inherited the
family possessions and wealth, and to have been in the front rank of
the country gentry. The explanation of the mistake as to his having
been a 'tanner,' is unexpectedly found in the Will of Thomas Bennett,
brother (as we shall see) of Sir John Davies' mother. Among other
things he leaves "a certain mess, or tent, in West Hatch now (1591)
in the use of Edward Scannell, and all lands thereto belonging, [to]
be held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> by John Bennett my son, Thomas Rose and Nicholas Graye as
trustees to my own use for life, and after my decease to the use and
behoof" of various relatives, of whom one is described as "Edward Davys
of Tyssebury, <i>tanner</i>." This Edward Davys, tanner, was no doubt of the
Chisgrove family; and hence the confusion. In all probability he was
one of the younger sons, and so brother of our Sir John. When he came
to make his Will (now before me), though engaged in trade, he asserts
his gentility by styling himself 'gentleman.' So much in correction of
a second important biographical mistake.</p>

<p>John Davyes, of Chisgrove, was married to Mary, daughter of John
Bennett (alias Pitt) of Pitt House, Wilts., (Visitation of Wilts.,
1563) by Agnes his wife, daughter of ........ Toppe, of Fenny Sutton,
in Wilts. Hoare<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and others, give ample proof of the almost lordly
position of the Bennetts. Woolrych observes (1869) "The Bennetts of
Pyt, have been well known in our own time. The struggles of Bennet
and Astley for the representation of the county are remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>bered as
severe and costly."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Thus if Davyes of Chisgrove was of good blood
in the county, he certainly advanced himself when he wooed and won
a daughter of the house of Bennett (or Benett). They had at least
three sons. The first was Matthew, who became D.D., Vicar of Writtle,
Essex. Hoare (as before) calls him second son, and states that he died
unmarried. Both are inaccuracies. The Tisbury Register shews that
he was the eldest not the second son; and the Will of our Sir John
remembers his family.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The second son was (probably) the Edward who
became a "tanner." He was baptized at Tisbury 6th December, 1566. He
too is named in our Sir John's Will. The third was the subject of our
Memorial-Introduction. The following is his baptismal entry from (<i>a</i>)
the paper or scroll-copy, (<i>b</i>) the parchment or extended register of
Tisbury&mdash;<i>literatim</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Paper MS.: 1569 Aprill xvj. John the sonne of John Dauy was
crysten'd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Parchment MS.: Anno dni 1569 Aprill 16 John the sonne of John
Davis bapt.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></div>

<p>There were two sisters, Edith and Maria. Master John was in his 11th
year only when he lost his father, who died in 1580. The Carte MS.
"Notes" (as before) tell us: "his father dyed when hee was very young
and left him with his 2 brothers to his mother to bee educated. She
therefore brought them vpp all to learning." The same "Notes" state
"y<sup>t</sup> Iohn off whom we now write, being designed for a lawyer,
neglected his learning, butt being first a scholar in Winchester
Colledge, was afterwards removed to New Colledge in Oxford." According
to Chalmers (History of Oxford: I. p. 105) he became in Michaelmas term
1585, a Commoner of Queen's College, Oxford. From thence he removed
in 1587 (not 1588 as usually stated e.g. by Wood to George Chalmers
and Woolrych). The Admission Register of the Middle Temple contains
his entry, and it is interesting additionally as establishing that his
father was of the New Inn, London, and so of the legal profession:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="author">

<p>This 'entry' renders null all speculations as to whether by 'New
Inn' were not intended 'New Hall' Oxford, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and it is a third
correction of important biographical errors hitherto.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that other Records of New Inn commence only with
the year 1674. So that we are without light on the residence in the
Middle Temple.</p>

<p>In 1590 the saddest of all human losses came on the young law-student
by the death of his mother, who was buried at Tisbury "<span class="smcap">XXV</span>th
of Marche, 1590." In this year he is again at the University of
Oxford; for in the "Fasti" (by Bliss, Vol. ii., p. 250) he is entered
under 1590 as taking the degree of Bachelor of Arts. I fear that with
the death of his lady-mother there ensued a full plunge into the
frivolities and gaities of the University and Inns of Court society.
It was a 'fast' period; and while his after-books prove conclusively
that he must have studied Law widely and laboriously, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> can be
little doubt that there were outbursts of youthful extravagance and
self-indulgence. None the less is it equally certain&mdash;rather is in
harmony therewith&mdash;that very early he mingled with the poets and wits
of the day. There is not a tittle of evidence warranting the ascription
of "Sir Martin Mar People his Coller of Esses Workmanly wrought by
Maister Simon Soothsaier, Goldsmith of London, and offered to sale upon
great necessity by John Davies. Imprinted at London by Richard Ihones.

moment concede his hastily alleged authorship. But in 1593 his poem of
"Orchestra, or a Poeme of Dauncing," was "licensed to Iohn Harison" the
elder. No earlier edition than that of 1596 has been proved; but the
"license" assures us that Harrison had negotiated for its publication
in 1593. The title-page of the 1596 edition is followed by a dedicatory
sonnet "To his very friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> Ma. Rich. Martin." The Reader may turn
to it "an' it please" him (Vol. I. p. 159): and "thereby hangs a
tale." The dedicatory sonnet, it will be seen, while characterizing
"Orchestra" as "this dauncing Poem," this "suddaine, rash, half-capreol
of my wit," informs us that his "very friend" Martin was the "first
mouer and sole cause of it, and that he was the Poet's "owne selues
better halfe," and "deerest friend." We have the time employed on it
too:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You know the modest Sunne full fifteene times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blushing did rise, and blushing did descend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I in making of these ill made rimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My golden howers unthriftily did spend:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet, if in friendship you these numbers prayse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will mispend another fifteene dayes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All this receives tragi-comical illumination from the fact that this
same "very friend" and "better halfe," and he who so sang of him, had
soon a deadly quarrel and estrangement. <span class="smcap">Richard Martin</span> became
Recorder of London, and one memorial of him is a Speech to the King
which, if it partakes of the oddities of Euphues, must also be allowed
to contain weighty and bravely-outspoken counsel: and thus he has come
down to posterity as a grave and potent seignior. Moreover, he became
Reader of his Society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> and M.P. for first Barnstaple, and later for
Cirencester. He appears, too, as the associate of Ben Jonson, John
Selden, and others of the foremost.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>But as a youthful law-student he was 'wild.' He fell under the lash of
the Benchers, having been expelled from the Middle Temple in February,
1591, for the part he took in a riot at the prohibited festival of the
Lord of Misrule. He was fast of tongue and ribald of wit, with a dash
of provocative sarcasm. Evidently he was one of those men who would
rather (as the saying puts it) lose his friend than his joke (however
poor the joke and rich the friend). A consideration of the whole facts
seems to show that again restored to the Middle Temple he had let loose
his probably wine-charged sarcasms at his friend Davies. Whether it
was so or not, he was ignobly punished. For against all "good manners"
not to speak of the "law" and discipline of the Court, Master Davies
came into the Hall with his hat on, armed with a dagger, and attended
by two persons with swords. Master Martin was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> seated at dinner at the
Barristers' Table. Davies pulling a bastinado or cudgel from under his
gown, went up to his insulter and struck him repeatedly over the head.
The chastisement must have been given with a will; for the bastinado
was shivered to pieces&mdash;arguing either its softness or the head's
asinine thickness. Having "avenged" himself, Davies returned to the
bottom of the Hall, drew one of the swords belonging to his attendants,
and flourished it repeatedly over his head, turning his face towards
Martin, and then hurrying down the water-steps of the Temple, threw
himself into a boat.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This extraordinary occurrence happened at the
close of 1597 or January of 1598. In 1595 he had been called to the
bar; but in February 1598 Davies was expelled by a unanimous sentence;
"disbarred" and deprived for ever of all authority to speak or consult
in law.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> These "outbreaks" and expulsions were familiar incidents;
and make us exclaim with Othello: "O thou invisible spirit of wine, if
thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil"&mdash;"O God, that
men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> brains!
that we should with joy, pleasure, revel and applause, transform
ourselves into beasts" (ii. 3). This is the all-too-plain solution
of these "high jinks." It was a disaster of the most ominous kind.
Nevertheless the dark cloud that thus fell across the noon of the
full-and-hot-blooded young Barrister folded in it a "bright light:"
or&mdash;if we may fetch an illustration from Holy Scripture, as Moses the
great Lawgiver of ancient Israel through the slaying of the Egyptian
was compelled to be a fugitive in the wilderness and therein to master
his native impulsiveness and passion, so was the "offender" in the
Hall of the Middle Temple through the disgrace and penalties incurred
forced into retirement and introspection. It was a costly price to
pay. But it is to be doubted whether if the enforced return to Oxford
and the self-scrutiny and penitence that calm reflection wrought there
had not arrested him, he ever would have given our literature "Nosce
Teipsum." His great poem bears witness to very poignant self-accusation
and humiliation. Towards the close you seem to catch the echo of sobs
and the glistening of tears; nor is it "preaching" to recognize a
diviner element still&mdash;his unrest and burden alike laid on Him Who
alone can sustain and help a "wounded spirit" in its trouble. Besides
the hazardous as disastrous incident with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> Martin, his "Epigrams"
by their <i>abandon</i> and general allusiveness reveal that he was the
associate of the "young gallants" of the city and lived "fast"; and so
give significance and interpretation to his later passionate regrets,
self-accusations and self-rebuke. How abased and yet in touches how
noble is this!</p>

<p>"Expelled" and "disbarred," he retired to Oxford and there "followed
his studies, although he wore a cloak." (Wood's <i>Athenæ</i>, as before,
ii. 401). To lighten severer studies he now leisurely composed that
"Nosce Teipsum" from which has just been quoted the remarkable close.
His vein must have been a "flowing" one; for it was published within
a year of his disgrace, viz. in 1599.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It was dedicated to the
"great Queen;" without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span> the all-too-common contemporary hyperbole of
laudation, yet showing the strange magnetism of her influence to win
allegiance from the greatest, even in her old age:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Loadstone to hearts and loadstone to all eyes."
</p>

<p>The Carte "Notes" (as before) thus tell the whole story and ratify
Anthony-a-Wood:&mdash;"Vpon a quarrell between him and Mr. Martin before
y<sup>e</sup> Judges, where he strooke Mr. Martin hee was confined and made a
prisoner: after w<sup>ch</sup> in discontentment he retired to y<sup>e</sup> countrye,
and writt y<sup>t</sup> excellent poeme of his Nosce Teipsum, w<sup>ch</sup> was so
well aprooved of by the Lord Mountioy after Lord Deputy of Ireland and
Earle of Devonshire, that by his aduise he publisht it and dedicated
it to Queen Elizabeth, to whom hee presented it, being introduced by
y<sup>e</sup> aforesaide Lord his pattron, and y<sup>e</sup> first essay of his pen
was so well relisht y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Queen encouraged him in his studdys,
promising him prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>ment, and had him sworn her servant in ordinary."
"Nosce Teipsum" was not his "first essay" so that perchance the meaning
is that its verse-dedication was his "first essay" in addressing the
Queen&mdash;his second being the Hymns to Astræa. The "Hymns to Astræa"
appeared in quick succession to "Nosce Teipsum" in the same year 1599.
They are dainty trifles; but from all we know of Elizabeth would be
received as "sweet incense." If they seem to us to-day flattering not
to say adulatory, it must be remembered that such was the <i>mode</i>. Much
later, Epistles-dedicatory from Bacon and others of the mighties,
and not to Elizabeth but to James&mdash;are infinitely fulsome compared
with the ideal praises of an ideal Elizabeth&mdash;that Elizabeth who had
stirred the nation's pulses through her great patriotic words when
"The Armada" threatened&mdash;in the most superlative of these "Hymnes."
Their workmanship is as of diamond-facets. The "bright light" of
olden promise was now "lining" the dark cloud. The discipline of
his retirement to Oxford did him life-long good. Speedily outward
events dove-tailed with the deepened ethical experience and resultant
character.</p>

<p>For despair and disgrace there came hope and help. For a career
that seemed arrested, a higher, and wider, and nobler opened out in
inspiriting perspective. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span> 1599-1600 he was in all men's mouths as a
Poet. The "Poetical Rhapsody" of Davison of these years would have been
rendered incomplete without contributions from "I. D.;" and so there
went to it those Minor Poems, that are read still with pleasure. So
early as 1595 George Chapman had printed his "Ovid's Banquet of Sence,"
with lines from "I. D." More important still, "Secretary Cecil" became
his friend and patron. "<i>By desire</i>" he prepared certain dialogues and
scenes for entertainments to the Queen. Three of these remain. The
first is "A Dialogue between a Gentleman Usher and a Poet."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The
second is "A Contention betwixt a Wife, a Widdow, and a Maide."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The third is "A Lottery: presented (as the heading states) before
the late Queene's Maiesty at the Lord Chancelor's House, 1601."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
These indicate that the recluse of Oxford was once more restored to
society, and that the supremest. The favour of the aged Queen was
capricious; but the "Lottery" that formed part of the entertainment
at the Lord Chancellor's marked the turning of the tide, in flood not
ebb. Through Elles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>mere steps were taken to cancel the "expulsion" and
"disbarring." He addressed a respectful and manly Petition to "his
Society." It was considered at a "Parliament of the Society, held on
the 30th October 1601." He had "presented" it in Trinity Term; but it
was adjourned until now. In the interval he had attended "the Commons"
and in November after making the admission and satisfaction required by
four Benches, it was unanimously agreed that he should be "restored to
his position at the bar and his seniority." He publicly pronounced his
"repentance" in due form on the feast of All Saints. This was done in
the Hall in the presence of Chief Iustice Popham, Chief Baron Periam,
Judge Fenner, Baron Savil, Sergeant Harris, Sergeant Williams, and the
Masters of the Bench." The legal or ceremonial part being completed,
and the Apology read in English, Davies turned to "Mr. Martin," then
present, and as he could offer no sufficient satisfaction to him,
entreated his forgiveness, promising sincere love and affection in all
good offices towards him for the future." "Mr. Martin" accepted the
tender thus made, and the re-instatement was completed.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> That the
reconciliation between Davies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span> Martin was formal rather than real
has been too hastily assumed. True, that when in 1622 Davies collected
his Poems, the Sonnet to Martin was withdrawn and a <i>hiatus</i> left
towards the close of "Orchestra." But both these things are otherwise
explainable. Both Elizabeth and Martin were now dead&mdash;the latter in
1618. Besides, it was only natural that the living friend should be
willing to remove all memory of the quarrel. The name should only
have revived it. This, and not a many-yeared carrying of an unclosed
wound is my judgment in charity. The restored 'Barrister' never forgot
his indebtedness to the Lord Chancellor. His dedication of his great
"Reports" of Irish Law Cases and their correspondence remain to attest
this&mdash;remain too to attest the reciprocal admiration, if a tenderer
word were not fitter, of Ellesmere.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> His words in the 'Reports'
dedication are more than respectful.</p>

<p>It would appear from the MS. dedication of a corrected MS. of "Nosce
Teipsum" to "the right noble, valorous, and learned Prince Henry, Earle
of Northumberland" that he must have joined in the intercession for
restoration, e.g.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then to what spirit shall I these noates commend,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But unto that which doth them best expresse;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>

</div></div>

<p>Contemporaneous with his full Restoration to his privileges at the
Bar, the student-lawyer&mdash;through influence that has not come down to
us&mdash;found his way into Parliament as M.P. for Corfe Castle. The House
'sat' for "barely two months"&mdash;October 27th to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span> December 29th" (1601).
It was the last Parliament of Elizabeth. The records of it are meagre
and unsatisfying, but sufficient is preserved to inform us that untried
and inexperienced in Parliament as he was, the member for Corfe Castle
at once came to the front. A long-continued warfare on the part of
the Commons against monopolies found in him a vehement defender of
the privileges of the House. The wary Queen, who always knew when to
give way, withdrew certain "patents" that had been granted and led to
grievous abuses; and Davies was appointed one of the "Grand Committee"
to thank her Majesty<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. He had spoken stoutly for procedure by "bill"
and not by "petition." Richard Martin supported the monopolies.</p>

<p>In 1602 a second edition "newly corrected and amended" of "Nosce
Teipsum" appeared. Still prefixed to it&mdash;and to his honour continued in
the third edition of 1608 when she was gone&mdash;was the verse-dedication
to the Queen. But it was now "the beginning of the end" with her.
Somewhat cloudily and thundrously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span> was the great orb westering. She
died on 24th March 1603. It argues that Davies had advanced in various
ways that he accompanied Lord Hunsdon to Scotland when that nobleman
went with the formal announcement of James' accession to the throne. A
pleasant anecdote has survived that when "in the presence" Lord Hunsdon
announced John Davies, the King&mdash;who if a fool was a learned one and
capable of discerning genius&mdash;straightway asked "whether he were 'Nosce
Teipsum'" and on finding he was its author, "embraced him and conceived
a considerable liking for him."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> That his position was regarded as a
potential one with the new King is incidentally confirmed by letters to
him from no less than Bacon, who addressing him in Scotland sought his
good influences in his behalf, using in one a sphinx-like expression
of "concealed poets" that it is a marvel Delia Bacon did not lay hold
of to buttress her egregious argument on the Baconian authorship of
Shakespeare's Plays.</p>

<p>Accompanying the King southward, Davies held his own at the English
court. The royal 'liking' grew: and the royal brain&mdash;small no doubt yet
alert and in a sense animated with patriotic feeling&mdash;was in earnest
study of what has till to-day proved England's difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>&mdash;Ireland.
Mountjoy (later Earl of Devonshire and husband of Sidney's
"Stella"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>) was sent as Lord-Deputy, and Davies accompanied him as
Solicitor-General for Ireland, for which office the "patent" is dated
25th November, 1603. Immediately almost on his arrival at Dublin, viz.
on 18th December, 1603, he was knighted. The date hitherto given has
been "at Theobald's 11th February 1607," but the records of the Ulster
King of Arms make it certain that the knighthood was conferred on 18th
December, 1603. On the same occasion his "crest" is described as "On a
mount <i>vert</i>, a Pegasus, <i>or</i>, winged, gules."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>I know no more noble story than the Work of Sir John Davies in and
for Ireland. Our collection of his Prose Works, wherein his State
Papers and Correspondence will appear <i>in extenso</i>&mdash;from H. M. Public
Record Office and other sources&mdash;will make it clear as day that
beyond all comparison he was the foremost man in the Government.
With the sheer hard toil of humblest attorney slaving for his daily
bread, there was a breadth of view, a self-denying resoluteness of
pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>pose to benefit his adopted country, a prescience of outlook
into the future combined with fearless and magnanimous dealing with
contemporary problems, a high-hearted resistance in the face of
manifold temptations to slacken effort, and a fecundity of resource
and fulness of knowledge and vigilance of observation, that ought to
be written on a white page of our national history. It is scarcely
possible to exaggerate the consuming labours and the actual and solid
results of Davies' almost ubiquitory activities in Ireland. In my full
Life of him I hope to make good to the uttermost this high praise.
Here and now a few outward facts alone can be stated. In 1606, by
patents dated successively 29th May, 1606, and 29th May, 1609,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> he
was promoted to be Attorney-General for Ireland, and was also created
Sergeant-at-Arms.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He went as "Judge of Assize." His Reports
and State Papers, and "Pleadings" and Letters, from 1603 onward,
demonstrate how firm was his grasp of circumstance, and how statesmanly
he marked out his plans, while his forensic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span> appearances astonish with
the omniverousness of his legal reading and knowledge of precedents.
Throughout he was 'backed' and cheered by his superiors in Ireland and
by the King and his ministers. So early as 9th September, 1604, the
Lord Chancellor thus wrote to Davies:&mdash;</p>

<p>A few years later&mdash;1608&mdash;one Letter in full&mdash;like all our MSS.,
now for the first time printed,&mdash;from the Lord Deputy&mdash;the noble
Chichester&mdash;must suffice as a specimen of many kindred.</p>

<p>Noble Mr. Attornie,</p>

<p>Since your departure hence I haue received two ioynt letters from you,

Sr. Neale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span> and Ocatiance [O'Sullivan?] had contriued their escape
and woulde haue as desperately attempted it, had I not preuented it
within these sixe nightes by a discoverie made vnto me, albeyt I keep
20 men euerie neight for the guarde of the Castle ouer and aboue the
warde of the same, whereof two or three lye in each of their chambers.
Their horses were come to the towne, and all thinges else in readines.
Sure these men doe goe beyond all nations in the worlde for desperate
escapes, Shane Granie Ocarratan [O'Sullivan?] after he was acquited
of three indictments, and as most men conceiued free from all danger
of the lawe, did on fridaye the 27th of Januarie cast himselfe out of
a wyndow in the topp of the Castle by the heelpe of a peece of rotten
match, and his mantell w<sup>ch</sup> brake before he was halfe waye downe,
and thoe he were presently discovered yet he escaped about supper tyme.</p>

<p>When I had written thus far worde was brought me that a passadge

hopinge you or some other w<sup>th</sup> letters, or other directions, was
arriued, but beinge advertised that the Recorder of this Cyttie only
w<sup>th</sup> a fewe other passengers had in this fayre weather wrought out a
passage by longe lyeinge att sea, although the wyndes were contrarie,
and that they came from London before Christmas and had no written
letters or message but in theise particulars, I fell to you againe.</p>

<p>And do now praye you to geue your best assystance and furtherance to

the scheated lands in Ulster. I am discreadited amonge them if they
should be forgotten, and sure the plantation woulde be weake w<sup>th</sup>
out them, for they must be the pyllers to support it. Those that
shall come from thence wyll not affect it in that kynde as these do,
to make it a settlement for them and theirs; and in respect of their

if I woulde haue given way to their desire. I wysh that an honorable

<p>During one of his 'circuits' in Ireland, he met Eleanor, daughter
of Lord Audley (afterwards Earl of Castlehaven) and was married to
her&mdash;though the date has not been traced. Her later years were darkened
with insanity of a strangely voluble type. It is to be feared she was
an ill "help-meet" for her husband. There is pathos, if also inevitable
comedy, in her career&mdash;not here to be entered on.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>While intensely occupied with his official duties, Sir John Davies did
not neglect his literary gift. He was making history every year&mdash;so
fundamental and per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>manent was the part he filled in Ireland&mdash;but the
Past was gone back on that he might fetch from it monition for the
Present, and hope for the Future. His imperishable book: "A Discourse
of the true reasons why Ireland has neuer been entirely subdued till
the beginning of His Majesty's reign," (4to)<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> will reward the most
prolonged study to-day. It was published in 1612. In the same year
he was made King's Sergeant and also elected M.P. for Fermanagh,
being the first representative for that county in the Irish House of
Parliament. He was likewise chosen to be Speaker of the House; but not
without a characteristically violent struggle between the Catholics
and Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> He delivered a notable speech "to the House" on
its opening in 1613.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In 1614 he appears in the House of Commons in
England as M.P. for Newcastle-under-Lyne:<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and his attendance in
England was preparatory to final retirement from Ireland. "Grants of
lands" there from the "forfeitures,"&mdash;which, if ever any righteously
acquired, he did<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>&mdash;gave him a special interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span> in Ireland as a
proprietor; but after all, for such a man, at such a time, to be
limited to Ireland, was but a splendid exile. It is not, therefore, to
be wondered at that having practically achieved all, and more than all,
he had been given to do, or himself originated, he sought to return.
It is usually stated (e.g. Chalmers, Woolrych, &amp;c., &amp;c.) that he so
returned in 1616; but it was not until 1619 that he did so finally and
absolutely; for in a letter under date "21 June, 1619," to Buckingham,
he is found still only pleading for retirement and for the transference
of his office to a relative.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> It is one of the treasures of the
Fortescue MSS, in the Bodleian,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and is as follows:</p>

characteristic, being full of legal 'precedents,' and noticeable in
their tracing up the verdict sought to abiding principles. He took
part in the memorable "case" of Frances, Countess of Somerset, for the
poison-murder of Sir Thomas Overbury. In the House of Commons he spoke
seldom; but when anything that concerned Irish interests came up he
never failed to contend in behalf of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Lightening his legal employments were a large correspondence and
'fellowship' with his most eminent contemporaries, and the collection
of his Poetical Works, in so far as he wished them to go down to
posterity. Of the former I select one undated letter to the illustrious
Sir Robert Cotton, with whom he had been early acquainted, and
associated in 1614, in re-establishing the Society of Antiquaries,
originally founded in 1590. One of these is a sprightly and pleasant
letter, and all the more welcome that most of his correspondence that
remains is official and grave. The lighter letter is as follows, from
MSS. Cotton: Julius C. III., p. 14: now paged 133, British Museum:</p>

<p>His Poems, as finally collected by him, appeared in a thin octavo
in 1622. His Prose Works he never collected, but allowed them to be
re-published separately. His "True Cause" passed through several
editions during his own life-time. One of his most important
prose-books after the "True Cause" brings us to the closing event
of his busy and various-coloured life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span> It is entitled in the first
issue, which was posthumous<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>&mdash;"The Question concerning Impositions,
Tonnage, Poundage, Prizage, Customs, &amp;c. Fully stated and argued, from
Reason, Law, and Policy. Dedicated to King James in the latter end of
his Reign." (1656.)</p>

<p>This historically-memorable treatise has already been reproduced in the
Prose Works.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Elsewhere I examine it critically.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It must suffice
here to state that later the King (Charles I.), having an impoverished
exchequer, had recourse to forced loans of various amounts. Hating the
control of Parliament, he persisted in substituting his will for law,
his "proclamation" for statute. Feeling the treacherousness of his
standing-ground of prerogative, the Judges were applied to, and with
loyalty to the monarch rather than to their country, they somewhat
favoured the King's 'demands.' Charles deemed their "opinion" to have
a somewhat "uncertain sound," and presented to the Judges a paper for
their signature, recognising the legality of the collection. This was
refused. One of the victims of the sovereign's wrath was Chief-Justice
Crew, who was "discharged" on the 9th of November, 1626 (Foss's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>
Judges, vi., p. 291). Sir John Davies was appointed as his successor;
and one cannot help recognising that the opinions revealed in his "Jus
Imponendi" contributed to the succession. For one, I should rather
have found Sir John Davies on the other side, spite of his great array
of "precedents" and ingenious applications to the then circumstances
and exigencies, and necessarily ignorant of the lengths Charles as
distinguished from James, was to proceed. Technically, there had been
"precedents" no doubt; but long "use and wont" had rendered so-called
regal rights obsolete, and it was insanity to revive them, as Charles
I.,&mdash;who inherited James's high notions of regal authority,&mdash;found out
when too late. But, passing to Davies, the "lean fellow" called Death
was nearer the Knight than was the Chief-Justiceship. Purple and ermine
robes were actually bought, but they were not to be donned. He had told
a Mr. Mead that he was at supper with the Lord Keeper on the 7th of
December,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and that he fully expected the great promotion. The air
was thick with "reports" to the same effect. He was found dead in his
bed on the morning of the 8th December, cut down, it has been supposed,
by apoplexy. Three days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span> after, he was interred in S. Martin's Church,
London. Later a double inscription for himself and his widow (who was
re-married to Sir Archibald Douglas,) long hung on the third pillar,
near the grave. The original Latin, with our translation, are as
follow:<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir John Davies had several children. One, who was semi-idiotic, was
drowned in Ireland. Others alleged to have been born, have not been
traced. His daughter Lucy, of the Inscriptions, and by whom, no doubt,
they were procured, became famous in her generation as Countess of
Huntingdon. We have to deplore that while we have a fine portrait
of her, none, as yet, has been found of her Father. His Will and

<p class="ph3"><a name="II_CRITICAL" id="II_CRITICAL">II. CRITICAL.</a></p>


<p>I shall limit myself in this second half of the Memorial-Introduction
to a brief statement and examination of certain characteristics of
the Poetry of Sir John Davies&mdash;the limitation being imposed by the
contents of the present volumes.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> There are Poets whose truest and
most certain fame rests on so-called minor poems; and yet commonly
their bulkier productions have over-shadowed these. From Milton to
Wordsworth it is to be lamented that to the many they should be
represented by "Paradise Lost" and "The Excursion"; or to descend,
that Thomas <i>Campbell</i> and Samuel <i>Rogers</i> should have so hidden
behind their "Pleasures of Hope" and "Pleasures of Memory" their rare
and real faculty as Poets&mdash;for while in the larger poems of Milton
and Wordsworth there is of the imperishable stuff that only genius
of a lofty type weaves, it is rather (<i>meo judicio</i>) in "purple
patches" than in the web as a whole. In Milton and Wordsworth you do
not read them at their high<i>est</i> in their Epics but in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span> shorter
poems; while Campbell and Rogers should long since have died out of
men's hearts had they left nothing behind them save the smooth and
prize-poem-like common-places of their "Pleasures." In Milton the
remark requires modification, for only in "Paradise Lost" has he put
forth to uttermost daring his Imagination&mdash;than which no writer of
all time has approached him for grandeur of vision and splendour of
utterance. But substantially I think that those capable of discernment
will agree with me that if Time may shut and leave unread except by
an elect few, many pages of the 'great' and volume-filling poems, the
lesser will assuredly draw more and more homage, and abide the regalia
of our Literature.</p>

<p>It is different with Sir John Davies. His "Orchestra" and "Hymnes to
Astræa" and Minor Poems, preceded considerably his "Nosce Teipsum," but
it was his "Nosce Teipsum" that made King James I. prick up his ears on
hearing his name, and it is "Nosce Teipsum" that is the poem that will
secure immortality to Sir John Davies. His other poetry has special
remarkablenesses&mdash;as will appear&mdash;but in "Nosce Teipsum" alone have
we the inspiration and spontaneity, the insight and speculation, the
subtlety and yet definiteness, the "burden" (in the prophetic sense)
and the melody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span> of the Poet as distinguished from the versifier or
verse-Rhetorician.</p>

<p>I value "Nosce Teipsum" as a first thing for its <i>deep and original
thinking</i>, i.e. for its <i>intellectual strength</i>&mdash;all the more
remarkable that as the former part of the Memorial-Introduction
shows, he was only in his 28th-29th year when he composed it. Of
its art I shall have somewhat to say anon: but regarding it as a
"<i>philosophical</i> poem" and as a contribution to metaphysic, I place
foremost the <span class="smcap">THOUGHT</span> in it, as at once a characteristic and a
merit (if merit be not too poor a word). <span class="smcap">Davies</span> (along with
<span class="smcap">Fulke Greville</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord Brooke</span> and <span class="smcap">Donne</span>)
simply as Thinker on the profoundest problems of nature and human
nature, seems to me to stand out pre-eminently, and in saying this, I
regard it as sheer nonsense to exalt the workmanship at the expense
of the material&mdash;to ask me to recognize in a bit of tin ingeniously
and painstakingly etched into a kind of miracle of execution something
co-equal with a solid bar of gold as it gleams i' the face of the sun
in its purged and massive simpleness; or to put it unmetaphorically,
I must pronounce judgment on the rank of a Poet <i>qua</i> a Poet
fundamentally on the kind and quality of the thought on higher and
deeper things that he puts into his verse and that he strikes out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
others. Your mere artist-Poet is surely third-rate and must even go
beneath the music-composer of to-day.</p>

<p>"Nosce Teipsum" as it was practically the earliest so it remains the
most remarkable example of deep reflective-meditative thinking in verse
in our language or in any language. The student of this great poem will
very soon discover that within sometimes homeliest metaphors there is
folded a long process of uncommon thought on the every-day facts of our
mysterious existence. I call the thinking deep, because "Nosce Teipsum"
reveals more than eyes that looked on the surface&mdash;reveals penetrative
and bold descent to the roots of our being and reachings upward to the
Highest. Your mere realistic word-painter of what he sees, is shallow
beside a Poet who passes beneath the surface and circumstance and
fetches up from sunless depths or down from radiant altitudes fact and
facts&mdash;each contributory to that ultimate philosophy which while it
shall accept every proved fact, will not rush off hysterically shouting
"eureka," with ribald accusations of all that generations have held to
be venerable and sustaining. I call the thinking original, for there
is evidence everywhere in "Nosce Teipsum" that the penitent recluse of
Oxford made his own self his study&mdash;as really if not as avowedly as
Wordsworth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span></p>

<p>I am aware in claiming originality for Davies that in that huge
waste-basket of our Literature&mdash;Nichols' Literary Illustrations
(Vol. IV. pp. 549-50) there is a letter from an Alexander Dalrymple,
Esq., who is designated "the great hydrographer" to "Mr. Herbert"
(the Bibliographer I opine) wherein he takes different ground. We
must traverse his charge. He thus writes:&mdash;"Dear Sir, I have lately
purchased the following old books" (he enumerates several).... "I have
also got 'Wither's translation of Nemesius de Naturâ hominis' by which
I find Sir John Davies's poem on the Immortality of the Soul is chiefly
taken from Nemesius" ... "I have picked up a tract in 4to. by Thomas
Jenner, with some very good plates, the marginal notes of which seem
to be what the heads of Tate's edition of Sir John Davies's are taken
from."</p>

<p>Were this true it would utterly take from "Nosce Teipsum" the first
characteristic and merit I claim for it&mdash;deep and original thought. But
it is absolutely untrue, an utter delusion, as any one will find who
takes the pains that I have done to read, either the original Nemesius,
or what this sapient book-buyer mentions, Wither's translation. With my
mind and memory full of "Nosce Teipsum" and the poem itself beside me,
I have read and re-read every page, sentence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span> word of Nemesius and
Wither (and there is a good deal of Wither in his translation: 1636)
and I have not come upon a single metaphor or (as the old margin-notes
called them) "similies," or even observation in "Nosce Teipsum" drawn
from Nemesius or Wither. The only element in common is that necessarily
Nemesius adduces and discusses the opinions of the Heathen Philosophers
on the many matters handled by him, and Sir John Davies does the same
with equal inevitableness. But to base a charge of plagiarism against
"Nosce Teipsum" on this, is to reason on the connection between
Tenterden Steeple and Goodwin Sands (if the well-worn folly be a
permissible reference). The following is the title-page of the quaint
old tome and as it is by no means scarce, any reader can cross-question
our witness: "The Nature of Man. A learned and useful Tract written
in Greek by Nemesius, surnamed the Philosopher; sometime Bishop of a
City in Ph&oelig;necia, and one of the most ancient Fathers of the Church.
Englyshed, and divided into Sections, with briefs of their principle
contents by Geo. Wither. London: Printed by M. F. for Henry Taunton in
St. Duncan's Churchyard in Fleetstreet. 1636." (12<sup>o</sup> 21 leaves and
pp. 661.) Chronologically&mdash;Wither's translation was not published until
1636, while "Nosce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span> Teipsum" was published in 1599; but Nemesius' own
book no more than Wither's warrants any such preposterous statements as
this Alexander Dalrymple makes. Even in the treatment of the "opinions"
of the Heathen Philosophers which come up in Nemesius, and in "Nosce
Teipsum," the latter while 'intermedling' with the same returns wholly
distinct answers in refutation. The "opinions" themselves as being
derived of necessity from the same sources are identical; but neither
their statement nor refutation. Nemesius is ingenious and well-learned,
but heavy and prosaic. Sir John Davies is light of touch and a light
of poetic glory lies on the lamest "opinion." The "Father of the
Church" goes forth to war with encumbering armour: the Poet naked
and unarmed beyond the spear wherewith he 'pierces' everything, viz.
human consciousness. Jenner's forgotten book had perhaps been read by
Tate, but that concerns Tate not Sir John Davies. I pronounce it a
hallucination to write "Sir John Davies' poem on the immortality of
the Soul is chiefly taken from Nemesius." Not one line was taken from
Nemesius.</p>

<p>Before passing on it may be well to illustrate here from the "contents"
of two chapters (representative of the whole) in Wither's Nemesius,
the merely super<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span>ficial agreement between them and "Nosce Teipsum." In
the Poem under "The Soule of Man and the Immortalitie thereof" various
opinions of its 'nature' are thus summarized:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One thinks the <i>Soule</i> is <i>aire</i>; another <i>fire</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Another <i>blood</i>, diffus'd about the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Another saith, the <i>elements</i> conspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to her <i>essence</i> each doth giue a part.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Musicians</i> thinke our <i>Soules</i> are <i>harmonies</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Phisicians</i> hold that they <i>complexions</i> bee;<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Epicures</i> make them swarmes of <i>atomies</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which doe by chance into our bodies flee." (p. 26.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Nemesius, c. 2. § I, the 'headings' are: "I. The severall and
different Opinions of the Ancients concerning the Sovl, as whether it
be a Substance; whether corporeall, or incoporeall, whether mortal
or immortal P. II. The confutation of those who affirme in general
that the Sovl is a corporeall-substance. III. Confutations of their
particular Arguments, who affirme that the Sovl is Blood, Water, or
Aire." These are all common-places of ancient 'opinion' and of the
subject; and anything less poetical than Nemesius' treatment of them is
scarcely imaginable. Here if anywhere Davies' indebtedness must have
been revealed; but not one scintilla of obligation suggests itself to
the Reader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span> Again in the Poem, after a subtle and very remarkable
'confutation' of the notion that the Soul is a thing of 'Sense' only,
there comes proof "That the Soule is more than the Temperature of the
humours of the Body;" and nowhere does Davies show a more cunning
hand than in his statement of the 'false opinion.' Turning once more
to Nemesius c. II. § 3, these are its 'headings:'&mdash;"I. It is here
declared, that the Soul is not (as Galen implicitly affirmeth) a
Temperature in general. II. It is here proved also, that the Soul is no
particular temperature or quality. III. And it is likewise demonstrated
that the Soul is rather governesse of the temperatures of the Body,
both ordering them, and subduing the vices which arise from the bodily
tempers." Here again we would have expected some resemblances or
suggestions; but again there is not a jot or tittle of either. Thus
is it throughout. One might as well turn up the words used in "Nosce
Teipsum" in a quotation-illustrated Dictionary of the English Language
(such as Richardson's) and argue 'plagiarism' because of necessarily
agreeing definitions, as from a few scattered places in "Nosce Teipsum"
discussing the same topics, allege appropriation of Nemesius. Your mere
readers of title-pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span> and contents, or glancers over indices are
constantly blundering after this fashion. Dalrymple was one of these.</p>

<p>The headings of the successive sections&mdash;removed in our text from
the margins to their several places&mdash;suffice to inform us of the
original lines of thought and research and illustration pursued in
"Nosce Teipsum" and thither I refer the Reader. The merest glance
will show that in "Nosce Teipsum" you have the whole breadth of the
field traversed&mdash;and that for the first time in Verse. I can only very
imperfectly illustrate either the depth or the originality of the poem.
Almost as at the opening of the book, take these uniting both:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The second stanza contains a metaphor that was stolen and murdered as
well, by Robert Montgomery. Concerning <i>his</i> use of it Macaulay thus
wrote in his merciless review:&mdash;"We would not be understood, however,
to say that Mr. Robert Montgomery cannot make similitudes for himself.
A very few lines further on we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</a></span> one which has every mark of
originality and on which we will be bound, none of the poets whom he
has plundered will ever think of making reprisal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The soul aspiring, pants its source to mount,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As streams meander level with their fount.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"We take this to be on the whole the worst similitude in the world.
In the first place, no stream meanders, or can possibly meander level
with its fount. In the next place, if streams did meander level with
their fount, no two motions can be less like each other than that of
meandering level and that of mounting upwards." True; but none the less
is the original 'spoiled' and despoiled metaphor, accurate and vivid.</p>

<p>If the Reader will surrender himself to the task, he will be rewarded
for studying and re-studying the entire poem of "Nosce Teipsum;" and,
unless I very much mistake, will then regard Hallam's judgment on it
as inadequate rather than exaggerate, as (with intercalated remarks),
thus: "A more remarkable poem [than Drayton's and Daniel's] is that
of Sir John Davies, afterwards Chief Justice of Ireland [a mistake],
entitled, 'Nosce Teipsum,' published in 1599, usually, though rather
inaccurately, called 'On the Immortality of the Soul.' Perhaps no
language can produce a poem, extending to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</a></span> so great a length, of
more condensation of thought, or in which fewer languid verses will
be found. Yet, according to some definitions [of poetry] the 'Nosce
Teipsum' is wholly unpoetical, inasmuch as it shows no passion [a
greater blunder still] and little fancy [a third mistake]. If it
reaches the heart at all, it is through the reason. But since strong
argument in terse and correct style fails not to give us pleasure in
prose, it seems strange that it should lose its effect when it gains
the aid of regular metre to gratify the ear and assist the memory.
Lines there are in Davies which far out-weigh much of the descriptive
and imaginative poetry of the last two centuries, whether we estimate
them by the pleasure they impart to us, or by the intellectual vigour
they display. Experience has shown that the faculties familiarly
deemed poetical are frequently exhibited in a considerable degree,
but very few have been able to preserve a perspicuous beauty without
stiffness or pedantry (allowance made for the subject and the times),
in metaphysical reasoning, so successfully as Sir John Davies."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
The alleged "no passion" is contradicted by the various pathetic
autobiographic introspections and confessions brought out in this
Memorial-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</a></span>Introduction, and not less so by the outbursts of adoration
and praise that thunder up like the hosannahs before the great White
Throne. The similarly alleged "little fancy" is one of manifold proofs
that the critic was the most superficial of all imaginable readers with
so much pretention. "Nosce Teipsum" is radiant as the dew-bedabbled
grass with delicacies of fancy, not a few of the "fancies" being as
exquisitely touched as divine work.</p>

<p>Campbell in his "Essay on English Poetry" (prefixed to his
"Specimens") may be read with interest after Hallam. Accepting from
Johnson as Johnson from Dryden the name of "metaphysical poets," he
observes:&mdash;"The term of metaphysical poetry would apply with much more
justice to the quatrains of Sir John Davies and those of Sir Fulke
Greville, writers who, at a later period, found imitators in Sir Thomas
Overbury and Sir William Davenant. Davies's poem on the Immortality
of the Soul, entitled "<i>Nosce teipsum</i>," will convey a much more
favourable idea of metaphysical poetry than the wittiest effusions of
Donne and his followers. Davies carried abstract reasoning into verse
with an acuteness and felicity which have seldom been equalled. He
reasons undoubtedly with too much labour, formality, and subtlety,
to afford uniform poetical pleasure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[Pg lxxvii]</a></span> The generality of his stanzas
exhibit hard arguments interwoven with the pliant materials of fancy so
closely, that we may compare them to a texture of cloth and metallic
threads, which is cold and stiff, while it is splendidly curious. There
is this difference, however, between Davies and the commonly-styled
metaphysical poets, that <i>he</i> argues like a hard thinker, and <i>they</i>,
for the most part, like madmen. If we conquer the drier parts of
Davies' poem, and bestow a little attention on thoughts which were
meant, not to gratify the indolence, but to challenge the activity of
the mind, we shall find in the entire essay fresh beauties at every
perusal: for in the happier parts we come to logical truths so well
illustrated by ingenious similes, that we know not whether to call the
thoughts more poetically or philosophically just. The judgment and
fancy are reconciled, and the imagery of the poems seems to start more
vividly from the surrounding shades of abstraction."</p>

<p>The 'coldness' of 'cloth and metallic threads' which the critic applies
to the 'hard arguments' of <i>Nosce Teipsum</i> is a mere imagination. But
besides, the 'metallic threads' are not for warmth but for splendour.
The lining of the 'splendidly curious' garment is to be looked for for
warmth. Similarly the 'hard argu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</a></span>ments' would have been unpoetical as
unphilosophical had they been 'warm' with the warmth of the 'clothing'
in similes and fancies. The 'hardness' is where it ought to be&mdash;in
the thinking: but it is a hardness like the bough that is green with
leafage and radiant with bloom and odorous with 'sweet scent' and
pliant to every lightest touch of the breeze. The leaf and bloom start
from the 'hard' bough rightly, fittingly 'hard' to its utmost twig. The
alleged 'too much labour' is singularly uncharacteristic. As for the
'madness' I can but exclaim&mdash;Oh for more of such 'fine lunacy' as in
Donne is condemned! His and compeers' 'madness' is worth cart-loads of
most men's sanity.</p>

<p>In our own day Dr. George Macdonald has spoken more wisely if still
somewhat superficially of "<i>Nosce Teipsum</i>" in his charming "England's
Antiphon." Having explained that by "Immortality of the Soul" is
intended "the spiritual nature of the soul, resulting in continuity
of existence," he proceeds:&mdash;"It [<i>Nosce Teipsum</i>] is a wonderful
instance of what can be done for metaphysics in verse, and by means
of imaginative or poetic embodiment generally. Argumentation cannot
of course naturally belong to the region of poetry, however well
it may comport itself when there natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[Pg lxxix]</a></span>ized; and consequently,
although there are most poetic no less than profound passages in the
treatise, a light scruple arises whether its constituent matter can
properly be called poetry. At all events, however, certain of the
more prosaic measures and stanzas lend themselves readily, and with
much favour, to some of the more complex of logical necessities. And
it must be remembered that in human speech, as in the human mind,
there are no absolute divisions: power shades off into feeling; and
the driest logic may find the heroic couplet render it good service."
(pp. 105-6). The 'scruple' must be 'light' indeed that has to decide
whether the 'reasoning' of "Nosce Teipsum" be or be not 'poetry.' It
is astounding that at this time o' day any should attempt to exclude
the highest region of the intellect and its noblest occupation from
poetry. Poetry I must hold absolutely is poetry, whatever be its matter
and form if the thinking be glorified by imagination or tremulous with
emotion. It is sheer folly to refuse to the Poet any material within
the compass of the universe. Especially deplorable is it to have to
argue for possibilities of poetry in the greatest of all thinking,
viz., metaphysics, in the face of such actualities of achievement as in
Davies and Lord Brooke and Donne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">[Pg lxxx]</a></span></p>

<p>A second characteristic of "Nosce Teipsum" that calls for notice
is its <i>perfection of workmanship</i> shown in the <i>mastery of an
extremely difficult stanza</i>, as well as its solidity of material.
Here unquestionably Sir John Davies far excels Lord Brooke and Donne,
and later, Sir William Davenant in "Gondibert." The two former are
occasionally (it must be granted) semi-inarticulate, and the last
is very often monotonous and trying. "Nosce Teipsum" is throughout
articulate and unmistakeable, and never flags. You have a fear o'
times that a metaphor will prove grotesque or mean: or a vein of
thought pinch and go out from ore to bare limestone. But invariably an
imaginative touch, or a colour-like epithet, or a thrill of emotion,
lifts up the mean into a transfiguring atmosphere as of sun-set purples
and crysolites, and gives to grotesquest gargoyles (as of cathedrals)
a strange fitness. Then when a thought or illustration seems about
to end, debasedly, another forward-carrying and ennobling, swiftly
succeeds.</p>

<p>There is more than dexterity, there is consummate art&mdash;the art of a
conscious master&mdash;in the inter-weaving of the lines and stanzas of
"Nosce Teipsum." Professor Craik recognised the difficulty and the
triumph, but fails by ultra-ingenuity in accounting for either the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">[Pg lxxxi]</a></span>
selection of the measure or the miracle of its continuous success.
His criticism is worth recalling, thus:&mdash;"A remarkable poem of this
age ... is the 'Nosce Teipsum' of Sir John Davies ... a philosophical
poem, the earliest of the kind in the language. It is written in rhyme,
in the common heroic ten-syllable verse, but disposed in quatrains,
like the early play of Misogonus, already mentioned, and other poetry
of the same era, or like Sir Thomas Overbury's poem of 'The Wife,'
the 'Gondibert' of Sir William Davenant, and the 'Annus Mirabilis' of
Dryden, at a later period. No one of these writers has managed this
difficult stanza so successfully as Davies: it has the disadvantage
of requiring the sense to be in general closed at certain regularly
and quickly-recurring turns, which yet are very ill adapted for an
effective pause; and even all the skill of Dryden has been unable to
free it from a certain air of monotony and languor,&mdash;a circumstance of
which that poet may be supposed to have been himself sensible, since he
wholly abandoned it after one or two early attempts. Davies, however,
has conquered its difficulty; and, as has been observed, 'perhaps no
language can produce a poem, extending to so great a length, of more
condensation of thought, or in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">[Pg lxxxii]</a></span> fewer languid verses will be
found.' (Hallam, as before.) In fact, it is by this condensation and
sententious brevity, so carefully filed and elaborated, however, as
to involve no sacrifice of perspicuity or fulness of expression, that
he has attained his end. Every quatrain is a pointed expression of a
separate thought, like one of Rochefoucault's maxims; each thought
being, by great skill and painstaking in the packing, made exactly to
fit and to fill the same case. It may be doubted, however, whether
Davies would not have produced a still better poem if he had chosen a
measure which would have allowed him greater freedom and real variety;
unless, indeed, his poetical talent was of a sort that required the
suggestive aid and guidance of such artificial restraints as he had to
cope with in this; and what would have been a bondage to a more fiery
and teeming imagination, was rather a support to his."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Most of this must be read <i>cum grano salis</i>. Davies elected his
measure and stanza with evidently entire spontaneity; and it is an
odd reversal of the simple matter of fact to ascribe the 'artificial
restraints' chosen, to an absence 'of a fiery and teeming imagination,'
when, as all observation demonstrates, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii">[Pg lxxxiii]</a></span> fiery and fecund
the imagination of a Poet, the more exquisitely obedient is he to
the subtlest and most intricate movements of his measure&mdash;just as
the bluest-blooded race-horse is a law to itself whereas your stolid
dray-cart or plough-drawer needs the "artificial restraints" of all
kinds of gear, and the constraint of whip and blow and vociferation. I
can well suppose that but for the "Fairy Queen" Sir John Davies might
have chosen its stanza, but just as to-day "In Memoriam" has taken
to itself its form and music to the exclusion of every other&mdash;though
a very ancient English measure&mdash;so Spenser's immortal poem precluded
"Nosce Teipsum" following in the same. I cannot admit "artificial
restraints" in the sense of needed restraints or aid. There was the
stanza, and the genius of Sir John Davies appropriated it&mdash;since
Spenser's, in all worship, could not be taken&mdash;and, like a great Vine,
clad its natural slenderness and poorness of build with wealth of
bright green leafage and clustered fruitage. The nicety and daintiness
of workmanship, the involute and nevertheless firmly-completed and
manifested imagery of "Nosce Teipsum" wherewith this nicety and
daintiness are wrought, place Sir John Davies artistically among the
finest of our Poets. Southey wrote decisively on this:&mdash;"Sir John
Davies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[Pg lxxxiv]</a></span> Sir William Davenant, avoiding equally the opposite faults
of too artificial and too careless a style, wrote in numbers which, for
precision and clearness, and felicity and strength, have never been
surpassed." For 'felicity' I should have said 'flexibility.'<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<span class="i0">"Heere <i>Sense's apprehension</i>, end doth take;</span><br />
<span class="i2">As when a stone is into water cast,</span><br />

</div></div>


<p>
These two characteristics, viz., (1) <i>deep and original thinking</i>,
(2) <i>perfection of workmanship, or mastery of an extremely difficult
stanza</i>&mdash;embrace that in "Nosce Teipsum," regarded broadly, which
I am anxious to have the Reader recognize and 'prove' for himself.
Subsidiary to them is one other thing&mdash;not shared with many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[Pg lxxxix]</a></span>our Poets and therefore demanding specific statement&mdash;viz. its
<i>condensation throughout</i>. Hallam and Craik have called attention to
this; and the student cannot fail to be struck with it. It is not
simply that the stanzas are as so many rings of gold each complete in
itself&mdash;much as Proverbs are&mdash;but that whether it be idea or opinion or
metaphor there is no beating of it out, as though yards of gold-leaf
or tin-foil were more valuable than the relatively small solid ore
that has been so manipulated: or the common mistake of imagining that
a pound of feathers is heavier than a pound of lead. From Dean Donne
until now "comparisons are odious." Nevertheless when one recalls
the attenuated thought and the blatant verbiage of not a few of our
Poets, this resolute sifting out of everything extraneous is not less
noticeable than commendable. It assures us that the Poet was conscious
of his resources&mdash;of his unused wealth of thought and imagination and
fancies. He who compacts his carbon into a Koh-i-noor has infinite
supplies of it. Similarly a Poet who could and did so lavishly add
great thought to great thought and vivid metaphor to vivid metaphor,
and still go on adding in smallest possible compass, declares his
intellect to be of the highest. I take two stanzas as illustrative
equally of condensed thought and condensed metaphor concerning our

<p>We may not linger over "Nosce Teipsum." Passing to the "Hymnes to
Astræa" and "Orchestra, or a Poeme of Dauncing" while they have the
same characteristics with "Nosce Teipsum," they yet suggest another
characteristic in Davies as a Poet&mdash;<i>unexpectedness of brilliant and
great things</i>. You count on the Lark's up-springing and the Lark's
idyllic song, if you are traversing its bladed or daisied possession;
but you are startled if it rise from the mired or dusty street or
the inodorous slum. You look for the eagle when you have climbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">[Pg xciii]</a></span>Shehallion and other Highland mountain fastnesses; but suppose it
were to flap out upon you as you paced into your semi-suburban villa.
So in "Nosce Teipsum," as seen, deep thought perfectly worked is what
knowing the Poet you look for therein; but even in "Hymnes to Astræa"
and "Orchestra" you very soon discover that it is still the Poet of
"Nosce Teipsum" who sings. The moods of thought are airier and more
vivacious substantively, but the thinking and shaping and colouring of
imagination is the same; and 'unexpected' is really <i>the</i> word that
seems to me to express the out-flashing of the higher faculty. Turning
to the "Hymnes to Astræa," how exquisite are the fancy and the flattery
of Hymne V., "To the Larke," as she is wooed by the Poet-Courtier to be
his minstrel to 'sing' of Elizabeth. You do not for a moment feel the
'artificial restraint' of the margin-letters that go to form Elizabetha

<p>That the large and intense homage of Davies (among his illustrious
contemporaries), in these "Hymnes" was genuine not simulated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">[Pg xcv]</a></span>spontaneous not mercenary, the apostrophe to Envy protests. With an
echo of the old 'exegi monumentum' or reminiscence of Shakespeare's
then not long published Sonnets, he thus writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>Then in "Orchestra" you are again and again reminded that, mere sport
of wit though it be, "suddaine, rash, half-capreol of my wit," as he
himself calls it to Martin (p. 159), it is a man of rare genius who
sports. So much so that ever and anon you perceive, as Cleopatra of her

</div></div>

<p>That is, even among the trivialities about 'Dauncing' and the
frivolities of laudation, you are re-called to grander things&mdash;as in
the Summer one sees breaks of blue in the over-arching sky above some
miserable Pick-nick party desecrating some glorious forest-dell. I cull
two out of manifold examples of the unexpectedness that I now wish to
point out&mdash;as thus of the antiquity yet vitality of 'Dauncing':&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii">[Pg xcvii]</a></span>
I know not where, outside of Milton, to match that personification of
the Sea, with its "great chrystall eye"; and 'palid' is as tenderly
delicate as the other is grand. Coleridge must have carried it in his
omniverous memory, for surely one of the most memorable of the stanzas
in his "Ancient Mariner" drew its inspiration thence, as thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Still as a slave before his lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ocean hath no blast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His great bright eye most silently<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If he may know which way to go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she guides him smooth or grim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, brother, see! how graciously<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She looketh down on him." (Pt. VI.)</span>

<p>At this point it may interest some to read Sir John Harington's welcome
to the Poet on the publication of 'Orchestra', thus:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>I am tempted to further critical examination of this very remarkable
Poetry; but feel constrained by already transgressed limits to withhold
them for the present. But I must say something on the Epigrams
and Minor Poems. I have 'compunctious visitings' in re-publishing
them, even though they have been included by Dyce and by Colonel
Cunningham in their successive editions of Marlowe. In my Note (Vol.
II., pp. 3-6), I give bibliographical and other details concerning
these Epigrams; and I correct a mis-assignation of certain by Dyce
to Davies that belong to Henry Hutton. It must be conceded that the
Epigrams have dashes of the roughness, even coarseness, of the age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcix" id="Page_xcix">[Pg xcix]</a></span>They self-drevealingly belong to the wild-oats sowing of the Poet's
youthful period. Nevertheless, I have ventured their reproduction in
integrity for four reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) These Epigrams, from their subjects and style, are valuable, as
expressing the <i>tone</i> of society at the time.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It would be <i>suppressio veri</i> to withhold them, toward an
accurate estimate of their Author. They furnish elements of judgment.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) They were what gained the Poet 'a name': even when tartly spoken
of by Guilpin he is called the 'English Martial' from them.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) These Epigrams belong to a section of our early Literature
that contemporaneously was abundant; and it were advantageous if
characteristics of particular periods were more recognised in literary
criticism.</p>

<p>Besides Guilpin, a very rare volume of early Verse by Ashmore,
furnishes a hitherto overlooked Epigram, wherein "Nosce Teipsum" and
the Epigrams, are noticed with well-put praise. I am fortunate enough
to be able to give it, which I do in its English form only, the Latin
being poor and inaccurate. It is inscribed "Ad D. Io. Davies, Milite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_c" id="Page_c">[Pg c]</a></span>Iudicem Itinerium" and thus runs:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Where thou the Essence of the Soule confines;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where sportingly, these looser times thou blames:<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>His name-sake, John Davies of Hereford similarly saluted him. His
'Lines' with others, will appear more fitly in the fuller 'Life.'
Meanwhile, as carrying within it, perhaps the most memorable
circumstance appertaining to these 'Epigrams,' I must ask attention
here, to one of Wordsworth's finest minor poems&mdash;his</p>

<span class="i0">Thus Orpheus to such hearers giveth musick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Philo to such patients giveth physic."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Any charge of plagiarism were an outrage on Genius: but the coincidence
is remarkable. It is just possible that the later Poet may have found
the 'Epigrams' in his bookish friend <span class="smcap">Southey's</span> library,
and that the rough lines lingered semi-unconsciously in his memory.
The earlier is to the later, as a photograph of the actual coarse
street-group to the idealizations of the Artist: nevertheless it has
its own interest and value, neither are the Characters ill-chosen, nor
without humour.</p>

<p>But on the other hand Davies, in his 47th Epigram, was no doubt
influenced by a remembrance of Sidney's 30th Stella sonnet. The
likeness as to the countries mentioned is remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>One flagrant appropriater of Davies' Epigrams must be nailed-up, in
the person of William Winstanley in his "The Muses Cabinet stored with
variety of Poems, both pleasant and profitable. London 1655." Thus we
read "On Rembombo":&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_civ" id="Page_civ">[Pg civ]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rembombo having spent all his estate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went to the wars to prove more fortunate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being return'd, he speaks such warlike words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No dictionary half the like affords:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He talks of flankers, gabions and scalados,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of curtneys, parapets &amp; palizados,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retreats &amp; triumphs &amp; of carnisadoes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sallies, halfe moones &amp; of ambuscadoes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I to requite the fustian termes he uses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reply with words belonging to the Muses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Spondes, Dactiles &amp; Hexameters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stops, commas, accents, types, tropes, &amp; pentameters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Madrigalls, Epicediums, elegies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Satyres, Iambicks, &amp; Apostrophes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acrosticks, Aquiuoques, &amp; epigrams:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus talking and being understood by neither,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We part wise as when we came together." (p. 43)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Let the Reader compare this with Davies' Epigram (Vol. II., p. 23-4).
Various others are similarly transmogrified; and John Heath also is
'spoiled' (in a double sense). Yet has Winstanley the impudence to
close his volume bitingly thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Cease Muse, here comes a criticke, close thy page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These lines are not strong enough for this age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nice new-fangled readers of these times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will scarcely relish thy plain country rimes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Minor Poems, not hitherto collected, will reward critical perusal.
Some of them are noticeable:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cv" id="Page_cv">[Pg cv]</a></span> quaint fancies, glances of wit and
wisdom, felicitous epithet, racy similes, aphoristic sayings, bird-like
notes of genuine music, and now and then, powerful sarcasm, will meet
the studious reader. The <span class="smcap">Hitherto Unpublished MSS.</span>, which
include, besides secular poems, his long vainly-sought Metaphrase
of certain Psalms, speak for themselves. And so I leave the Reader
to raise the lid of the casket of gems now put into his hands. It
demands robustness of brain and sensibilities of spirit to appreciate
adequately Sir John Davies as a Poet; but if, in all humility of
receptiveness and open-eyedness, these volumes be read, no one
competent can go away unimpressed. Whether as Thinker or Singer he must
be placed among the rare few who have enriched our highest Literature.</p>

<p class="ph3"><a name="POSTSCRIPT" id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT.</a></p>

<p class="ph4">MINOR POEMS, ETC.</p>


<p>There are several things relative to the Minor Poems of Sir John Davies
that require statement and elucidation; and I deem it well to give such.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. The Ten Sonnets to Philomel and Hymn to Music.</p>

<p>II. The Entertainment to Elizabeth at Harefield by the Countess of
Derby.</p>

<p>III. The Poem to King James 1st.</p>

<p>IV. Dacus not Samuel Daniel.</p>

<p>V. Marston and "Orchestra," &amp;c.</p>

<p>VI. Hymnes to Astræa.</p></div>

<p><i>I. The Ten Sonnets to Philomel and Hymn to Music.</i> In my Fuller
Worthies' Library edition of Davies, I admitted "Canzonet: a Hymne
in praise of Musick" among his Poems (pp. 297-9) because in the
"Rhapsody" it bore his initials I. D. precisely as his other accepted
pieces therein did. But I excluded the 'Ten Sonnets to Philomel' from
their having the signature originally of "Melophilus," and I. D. only
subsequently. I too hastily agreed with Sir Egerton Brydges (in his
edition of the "Rhapsody" 2 Vols., 1826) in assigning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cvii" id="Page_cvii">[Pg cvii]</a></span> them to Dean
Donne. I could not discern Donne's manner in the 'Canzonet,' and so
had no difficulty in rejecting Brydges' alleged 'internal evidence' in
respect of it, initialled as it was. Neither did I find the 'internal
evidence' in the 'Ten Sonnets' for its Donne authorship, but, in
addition to the early signature "Melophilus," there was a note of
"Manuscripts to get" by Davison, from Donne, that has seemed to warrant
the "Ten Sonnets" being regarded as his contribution, and the later I.
D. as representing J[ohn] D[onne], and not Sir John Davies. My friend
Dr. Brinsley Nicholson has satisfied me that Davison's List of MSS.
to be received could not refer to his "Rhapsody," but to some other
intended work or private collection; and so the one point in favour
of Donne falls to the ground. The evidence as communicated to myself,
and since, in a lengthy communication to the <i>Athenæum</i> (January 22d,
1876), may be thus summarized, (1) There is nothing in Davison's
notings which even hints that he was thinking of the "Rhapsody." (2)
The greater number of the MSS. mentioned never appeared even by a
specimen in the "Rhapsody." (3) The second entry is of</p>


<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Sports, Masks, and Entertainments">
<tr><td align="right" rowspan="2">"Sports, Masks, and Entertainments to y<sup>e</sup></td><td align="left">{ late Queen</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">{ the King," &amp;c.</td></tr>
</table>


<p>Therefore it was written in or after 1603. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cviii" id="Page_cviii">[Pg cviii]</a></span> first edition of
the "Rhapsody" containing the "Hymn to Music" signed I. D., and the
"Ten Sonnets" signed "Melophilus," and in the subsequent editions I.
D., was published in 1602, (4) There is not in the subsequent editions
a single piece by any of these memorandum-noted authors that is not in
the first&mdash;so shewing further that the memorandum had no reference to
the "Rhapsody." Of Donne and Constable there are in the editions 1608,
1611, 1621, only those given in 1602, and in no edition at all is there
a single specimen of Ben Jonson, Hodgson, Harington, Joseph Hall, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. There remains thus only (5). The I. D. evidence, e.g.:</p>

  <p class="center">Absence hear this my protestation. Unsigned in all four editions.</p>


<p>That two are unsigned in the 1621 edition is probably due to omission
made during the thorough re-distribution of the pieces into books of
Odes, &amp;c., &amp;c. Further (6) the "Hymn to Music" and the "Ten Sonnets"
follow consecutively, and are the very first among the "pieces by
sundry others." So in editions of 1608 and 1611 the "Twelve Wonders,"
"Lottery," and "Contention" are the first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cix" id="Page_cix">[Pg cix]</a></span> the new pieces, in
fact, open the book and follow one another successively in a group of
three&mdash;John Dauis&mdash;I. D.&mdash;John Davies. (7) We gather from inspection
of the "Table" that (<i>a</i>) the "Lottery," I. D., is John Davies; (<i>b</i>)
that Davison put I. D. after the "Lottery," knowing that he had already
appropriated I. D. to the author of the "Hymne;" and what is more, he
chose to put I. D. to the "Lottery" just when he associated the "Ten
Sonnets" with I. D. and John Davies' poems by altering Melophilus to
I. D.; (<i>c</i>) at the same time he left "Absence hear," &amp;c., unsigned;
(<i>d</i>) what has been said under (5) and (6) suggests that Davies was a
personal friend of Davison's, and this is strengthened by there being
no MS. of Davies noted as "to get." If so, Davison was still less
likely to use ambiguous initials for anything by Davies. Once more (8)
When we add to this that the "Hymne" must go with the "Ten Sonnets" and
that it is clearly by the author of "Orchestra"; and that neither the
"Hymne" nor the "Ten Sonnets" appear in any collection of Donne's poems
printed or in MS. the external evidence in favour of Sir John Davies
as author of the work is as strong as it well can be. Internally the
student of "Orchestra" and the "Hymnes to Astræa" will readily see the
"fine Roman hand" that wrote them in the "Hymne to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cx" id="Page_cx">[Pg cx]</a></span> Music" and related
"Ten Sonnets to Philomel." There is none of the style, or conceits, or
wording, or rhythm of Donne. I add finally (9) If the "Ten Sonnets to
Philomel" were based on real love experiences, we can understand how
at first at any rate the disguise of "Melophilus" might be preferred
to I. D. It does not seem probable that they were addressed to her who
became his wife. In accord with all this both the "Hymne to Music" and
the "Ten Sonnets to Philomel" are now included among Sir John Davies's
Poems (Vol. ii. pp. 96-106.)</p>

<p>II. <i>The Entertainment to Elizabeth at Harefield by the Countess of
Derby.</i> In the foot-notes to the "Lottery," (Vol. II., pp. 87-94)
several variations from Manningham's "Diary" are accepted as decided
improvements, especially those in <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, <span class="smcap">XIX.</span>,
and <span class="smcap">XXI.</span>, which were probably taken from a revised or
autograph MS. That Manningham had full information on the "Lottery"
is proved by the list he gives of the persons to whom the 'lots'
went, viz., <span class="smcap">I.</span>, To hir M<sup>tie</sup>. <span class="smcap">III.</span> La[dy]
Scroope. <span class="smcap">XXVII.</span> La[dy] Scudamore. <span class="smcap">VI.</span> Lady Francis.

But there remains an interesting question to be settled, viz., the
date of this "Lottery." Nichols, apparently on the sole authority of
the "Rhapsody," gives it to a visit to the Lord Keeper's town-house
[York House] in 1601; and assigns it to York House because Sir Thomas
Egerton did not buy Harefield till 1602, and clearly by the speeches
in the "Entertainment" the Queen had never been there before August,
1602. But the "Rhapsody" date is a slip of Davison's pen or of his
printer for 1602, and the "Lottery" took place at Harefield as part of
the "Entertainment." Notices in the "Lottery" itself guide us to this
conclusion, e.g., it was about August, for in Lot 22 we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis Summer yet,...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 'twill be winter one day, doubt you not."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the visit to Harefield was in August. Then there is this to
be noted that the masquer is "A Mariner ... supposed to come from
the Carrick." Let 'the' be marked '<i>the</i> Carrick.' The allusion is
historical. The Queen sent out Sir Richard Levison (or Lawson) and Sir
William Morrison on 19th and 26th March, 1602 to intercept the plate
fleet and do any other damage along the Spanish coast. They did not
get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxii" id="Page_cxii">[Pg cxii]</a></span> Fleet and were wholly unsuccessful till 1st June, when they
came upon an immense 'carrick' from the East Indies of 1,600 tons
flanked on one side by a castle and on the other by eleven Spanish and
Portugese galleys. On the 2nd the admirals with five men of war and
two merchantmen Easterlings, beat the gallies and silenced the castle,
and on the 3rd the carrick surrendered with a cargo estimated by the
Portugese at a million of ducats. Our killed in this brilliant exploit
was six seamen (see Camden's Annals and Monson's Naval Tracts). This
proves that the Verses were <i>vers d'occasion</i>. We have '<i>the</i> carrick'
and Cynthia who sent forth Fortune to the sea, and many a "jewel and a
gem" brought, and Fortune so commanded</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"as makes me now to sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no fishing to the sea, no service to the King."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Further, the Queen writing to Lord Mountjoy (Deputy to Ireland) 15th
July 1602 says "... first to assure you that we have sent a fleet
to the coast of Spain, notwithstanding our former fleet returned
with the Carrick," which shows two things (1) That Lawson and Monson
had returned prior to the 15th of July (2) that the Queen had sent
out another fleet at once; and thus Davies' verses were the more
appropriate as being not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxiii" id="Page_cxiii">[Pg cxiii]</a></span> only a remembrance of good luck but an
anticipation of continued good fortune.</p>

<p>These proofs of date which require no confirmation are confirmed by
this, that Manningham after the "Lottery," and on the same leaf,
gives a "dialogue betweene the bayly and a dairy mayd" before "her
Mtis coming to the house," quoting a sentence from it as found in the
"Entertainment." This leads me to state why I have given the entire
"Entertainment" to Sir John Davies. It certainly is contrary to natural
expectation that the "Lottery" verses are not introduced into the
"Entertainment," and but for other considerations the inference might
have been that only the "Lottery" was by Davies, and the rest by some
other. But there is this explanation of the absence of the "Lottery"
verses, that evidently they formed part of the amusement of one of
the rainy days&mdash;for it was a wet S<sup>t</sup>. Swithin&mdash;when the speeches
and other things of the "Entertainment" took place without doors,
and distinct from the "Lottery." Then on reading the "Entertainment"
itself, there are manifold marks that the whole came from one pen,
and that pen Davies's; for throughout there is likeness of style and
thought to his avowed writings. Take these few examples: (1) "If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxiv" id="Page_cxiv">[Pg cxiv]</a></span> thou
knewest the cause, thou wouldst not wonder; for I stay to entertaine
the Wonder of this time," &amp;c. ("Entertainment," &amp;c., Vol. II., pp.
249-50.) Cf. this with "Orchestra" st. 120, "wonder of posteritie"
(i.e., of her own time): (2) "The Guest that wee are to entertaine doth
fill all places with her divine vertues, as the Sunne fills the World
with the light of his beames." (<i>Ibid</i>, p. 250). Cf. Hymnes to Astræa,
XIV., stanza 2:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Behold her in her vertues' beames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extending sun-like to all realities."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again, XV., st. 1:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Eye of that mind most quicke and cleere,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sees through all things euery where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all their natures trieth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(3) "Though her selfe shall eclipse her soe much, as to suffer her
brightness to bee shadowed in this obscuere and narrow <i>Place</i>, yet the
sunne beames that follow her, the traine I meane that attends vpon her,
must, by the necessitie of this <i>Place</i>, be deuided from her." (<i>Ibid</i>,
p. 251). Cf. XIX., st. 1:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Eclipsed she is, and her bright rayes,<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxv" id="Page_cxv">[Pg cxv]</a></span></p>
<p>'Beams' and 'sunbeams' are favourite words with Davies: so too
'mirror.' (4) "Time weare very vngratefull, if it should not euer stand
still, to serue and preserue, cherish and delight her, that is the
glory of her time, and makes the Time happy wherein she liueth" (<i>Ibid</i>
p. 251). Cf. II. st. 3, ll. 1-3.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Right glad am I that now I live:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in these days whereto you give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great happiness and glory."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(5) "What if she make thee a contynewell holy-day, she makes me [Place]
a perpetuall sanctuary" (<i>Ibid</i> p. 251). Cf. IV., st. 1:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Each day of time, sweet moneth of May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love makes a solemne holy-day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(6) "Doth not the presence of a Prince make a Cottage a Court, and the
presence of the Gods make euery place Heaven?" (<i>Ibid</i> pp. 251-2). Cf.

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Stay long (sweet spirit) ere thou to Heauen depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which makest each place a heauen wherein thou art."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the Verse (pp. 253-4) there are abundant parallels. I must content
myself with references. With the 1st stanza</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beauties rose, and vertues booke, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxvi" id="Page_cxvi">[Pg cxvi]</a></span></p>
<p>compare Hymnes to Astræa VII., st. 3: XVII., st. 2-3 and the
"Contention" (<i>ad. fin.</i>) and XIII. st. 2: XV. st. 2. Also IV. last 2
lines: VII. st. 3. ll. 1-3: X. last 4 lines. Similar results are found
on a comparison of the "Entertainment" with the "Dialogue between a
Gentleman Usher and a Poet" (Fuller Worthies' Library edn. of Davies'
Poems: pp. 15-21.)</p>

<p>I have accordingly given the whole "Entertainment" as belonging to
Sir John Davies. It is to be regretted that the Satyrs Verses are
unaccompanied by the rest of the Masque to which apparently they
belong. Harefield has the further light of glory on it of having been
the scene of Milton's "Arcades" and of the famous elm-aisle celebrated
by him in imperishable verse. The Countess of Derby, afterwards the
Lord Keeper's third wife, was the early friend of Spenser and of
Milton, and of all her eminent literary contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxvii" id="Page_cxvii">[Pg cxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>III. "<i>Yet other Twelve Wonders of the World.</i>" In foot-note (Vol. II.,
p. 67) I promise an account of an autograph MS. of this characteristic
set of verses. It finds more fitting place here than in the Preface.
The MS. is preserved at Downing College, Cambridge, and having been
described on p. 325 of the "Third Report of the Historical MSS.
Commissioners," Mr. Beedham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxviii" id="Page_cxviii">[Pg cxviii]</a></span> (as before) was kind enough to make a
<i>literatim</i> transcript for me (with the permission of the College
authorities). The MS. is headed "Verses giuen to the L. Treasurer vpon
Newyeares day vpon a dosen of Trenchers by Mr. Davis." In the margin
against "The Lawyer," in the same handwriting as the Verses, is this:
"This is misplaced, it should be before the physis<sup>n</sup>," and similarly
against "The Country Gentleman," also in the same handwriting, is:
"This is misplaced, in the original it is before the m<sup>r</sup> chant."
There is nothing to give any clue as to the precise New Year's day upon
which the Verses were furnished to the Lord Treasurer; but unless I
very much mistake, they were the "cobweb" of his "inuention" enclosed
in that letter which Mr. J. Payne Collier supposed to have gone with a
gift-copy of "Nosce Teipsum." The letter speaks for itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>"Mr. Hicks. I have sent you heer inclosed that cobweb of my
invention which I promised before Christmas: I pray you present
it, commend it, and grace it, as well for your owne sake as mine:
bycause by your nominacion I was first put to this taske, for which
I acknowledge my self beholding to you in good earnest, though the
imployment be light and trifling, because I am glad of any occasion
of being made knowne to that noble gentl. whom I honore and admire
exceedingly. If ought be to be added, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxix" id="Page_cxix">[Pg cxix]</a></span> alter'd; lett me heare from
you. I shall willingly attend to doo it, the more speedily if it
be before the terme. So in haste I commend my best service to you.
Chancery Lane, 20 Jan. 1600. Yours to do you service very willingly,
Jo. Davys." (Bibl. Account, V. I., pp. 193-4; no specification of
source beyond S. P. O.)</p></div>

<p>The handwriting of the copy in Downing College belongs to the close
of the 16th or to the earliest years of the 17th century. The second
marginal note above would seem to show that the transcript was made
from the original, then perhaps being circulated from hand to hand.
Specimens of variations may interest. In "The Courtier," l. 1, for
'liu'd' the MS. reads 'serued': l. 4, "from them that fall" for "such
as fall": l. 5, "my" for "a rich array": in the "Divine," l. 1, "one
cure doth me contente" for "and I from God am sent": l. 3, "true kinde"
for "kind true": l. 5, "Nor followe princes' Courts" for "Much wealth
I will not seeke ": "The Souldier," l. 6, "brag" for "boast": "The
Physitian," l. 1, "prolonge" for "vphold" and "life" for "state": l. 2,
"I" for "me" (<i>bis</i>): l. 6, "time &amp; youth" for "youth and time": "The
Lawyer," l. 1, "My practice is the law" for "the Law my calling is":
ll. 5-6,</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxx" id="Page_cxx">[Pg cxx]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some say I haue good gifts, and love where I doe take</span>
<span class="i0">Yet never tooke I fee, but I advisd or spake,"</span>

<span class="i0">"Nor counsell did bewray, nor of both parties take,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor euer tooke I fee for which I neuer spake."</span>
</div></div>

<p>"The Merchant" l. 2, "vnknowne worlds ... kingdomes doth" for "unknowne
coasts ... countries to": "The Married Man," l. 4, "choise" for
"chance": "The Wife," l. 1, "my" for "our": l. 2, "Thither am I ...
where firste" for "I thither am ... from whence": l. 3,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I goe not maskd abroad to visit, when I do</span>
<span class="i0">My secrets I bewray to none but one or two,"</span>

<span class="i10">for</span>

<span class="i0">"I doe not visite oft, nor many, when I doe,</span>
<span class="i0">I tell my mind to few, and that in counsell too."</span>
</div></div>

<p>"The Widowe" l. 1, "dyinge" <i>is</i> inserted here before "husband": l.
3, "love" for "haue": l. 6, "Nor richer then I am, nor younger would
I seeme" for "Nor younger then I am, nor richer will I seeme": "The
Maide," l. 4, "of" for "on": l. 5, "but" for "yet." These embrace all
save orthographical and other slight variants. As derived from an
authentic <i>autograph</i> MS. the Downing College copy is interesting and
its variants serve further to illustrate the letter to Hicks wherein
Davies expresses his willingness to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxxi" id="Page_cxxi">[Pg cxxi]</a></span> any changes&mdash;which alone
might have led Mr. Collier to see that he could not possibly refer to
"Nosce Teipsum," which was then published.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Dacus not Samuel Daniel.</i> Turning to Epigrams 30 and 45 (pp.
30, 45) the reader will find in Dyce's note to the latter that he
identified 'Dacus' with Daniel, and the passage whereon he based the
identification. I passed his note though not at all satisfied with
the parallel of "dumb eloquence" to the Epigram's "silent eloquence."
Epigram 30 points rather to a rhymster of the John Taylor Water-Poet
type, and if one had patience to make the search "silent eloquence"
should doubtless be found in one or other of his many books&mdash;clumsily
appropriated from Sir Philip Sidney. Then the "dumb eloquence" of the
Complaint of Rosamond which Dyce quotes, was to the King <i>not</i> "to his
Mistress"&mdash;even if it were what the Epigram hints "silent eloquence."
<i>En passant</i> the phrases and variants on it was one of the aped phrases
of the gallants and poetasters of the day. Jonson who disliked Daniel,
ridicules the stanza in a way that informs us it was affected by them.
Griffin in his <i>Fidessa</i> also has it in his "dumb message of my hidden
grief." Further: Davies of Hereford in his "Scourge of Folly" who must
have known his namesake's use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxxii" id="Page_cxxii">[Pg cxxii]</a></span> Dacus calls him Dacus the pot-poet
and speaks as much against his character as our Davies does against his
rhymes&mdash;all of which was curiously inapplicable to Samuel Daniel. At
the time Davies of Hereford wrote Daniel was a gentleman of the Queen's
bed-chamber. Lastly&mdash;and conclusively&mdash;Sir John Davies praises three
English poets in his "Orchestra" (Elizabethan edn.) of whom one is
Daniel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O that I could old Gefferie's Muse awake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or borrow Colin's fayre heroike stile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or smooth my rimes with Delia's servant's file."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(Vol. I. p. 212). It is a pleasure to be able to vindicate Sir John
Davies from abuse of so genuine a Poet-contemporary as Daniel, and
Daniel from so weighty an adverse judgment, had it really been
Davies's. To the same good friend who has so helped me elsewhere&mdash;Dr.
Brinsley Nicholson&mdash;I owe thanks for these too-long-delayed corrections.</p>

<p>V. <i>Marston and 'Orchestra.'</i> But if Harrington and Davies of Hereford
praised, there were others who had their jeers at Orchestra, e.g. John
Marston in his 11th Satire of his Scourge of Villanie, in ridiculing
the gallant who thinks of nothing but dancing, as he afterwards does
Luscus, who talks of nothing but Plays, and vents only play-scraps,
says (1599).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxxiii" id="Page_cxxiii">[Pg cxxiii]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who ever heard spruce skipping Curio<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere prate of ought but of the whirle on toe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="left" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Praise but Orchestra, and the skipping art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall command him, faith you have his hart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even capring in your fist."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then there follows (<i>meo judicio</i>) a reminiscence or two of the poem
itself, and a laugh at the "worthy poet." Thus in 'Orchestra,' st. 59,
we have</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"According to the musicke of the spheres,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and st. 60,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And imitate the starres cælestiall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and st. 71, speaking of Castor and Pollux:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where both are carried with an equall pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together iumping in their turning race,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and where, though 'iumping' is of course used in the sense not of our
'jumping' (leaping) but in that of equal or agreeing, as in "jump where
may find Cassio," or as where the folio (I. 1) has "just as this same
hour" the 4<sup>o</sup> Hamlet has "jump at this dead hour"; yet it has for the
context an unlucky sound and association. Hence Marston wickedly and
waggishly continues:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"A hall, a hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roome for the spheres, the orbs celestiall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will daunce Kemps jigge; they'le revel with neate jumps;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A worthy poet hath put on their pumps.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxxiv" id="Page_cxxiv">[Pg cxxiv]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O wits quick traverse but <i>sance ceo's</i> slowe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good faith 'tis hard for nimble Curio.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye gracious orbes, keepe the old measuring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All's spoilde if once yee fall to capering."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>VI. <i>Hymnes to Astræa.</i> I adhere to Sir John Davies' own form of
Astraea in the collective edition of 1621. Doubtless he and the Printer
meant it for "æ' not '&oelig;' inasmuch as besides Astraea's mythological
reign in the golden age over a people that became too wicked for her,
she became the constellation Virgo, as celebrated, among others, by
Barnfield in his <i>Cynthia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The whole of Hy. I. shows this, where
the flattery was specially apt to the subject on account of making
Astraea the daughter of Aurora: and so Hy. V. of the Lark: and Hy. XXI.</p>

<p>The next edition known to me, bears the date of 1618, along with
Orchestra and Hymnes to Astræa: and the last during the life-time of
the Author, was in the sm. 8vo of 1622, which volume contained the same
Poems with that of 1618.</p>

<p>Our text is a faithful reproduction, including the significant and
suggestive italics, of the last edition published by Sir John Davies,
viz., that of 1622, with the few various readings from the first and
subsequent editions. The following is the title-page and collation of
1622 edn.</p>

<p>In my first edition of Sir John Davies' Poems in the Fuller Worthies'
Library, I printed, perhaps with too hasty decision, at the bottom
of each page, certain slight MS. notes written by the famous Bp.
Hacket, in his copy of Nosce Teipsum (1599). When it was too late to
stop progress, the mere curiosity of the jottings was perceived. I do
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> deem it expedient to reproduce them here; but a specimen may be
acceptable, and here and there in the places, a few. I limit myself to
the Dedication:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Heading, 'soveraigne': Emmanuel [but Elizabeth was meant].</p>

<p>L. 1, 'maiestie': Elizabetha: and near it [meaningless] Richar[d]
Yeorck.</p>

<p>L. 1, 'North': Scotland [but erased], and so against 'sunne' (l. 2)
James, but erased.</p>

<p>L. 3, 'heauenly worth': Shewes for thy glory.</p>

<p>L. 5, 'alone': Supported by none but God.</p>

<p>L. 6, 'great States': Great affaires.</p>

<p>L. 8, 'the Almightie's hand': Per me reges regnant et dixi dii estis.</p>

<p>L. 10, 'Nature's dowre': Arte's excellence the gift of nature.</p>

<p>L. 13, 'Great Spirit': Deus.</p>

<p>L. 16, 'Cynthia': Luna.</p>

<p>L. 30, 'angell': Angellus Pommi.</p>

<p>L. 32, 'angell': [&#913;&#947;]&#947;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#934;&#8033;&#964;&#959;&#962;.</p>

<p>L. 33, 'Heauen': Superior: to the higher heauen.</p>

<p>L. 34, 'heauen': Inferior.</p></div>

<p>These suffice to show how carefully, if not always accurately, the
good Bishop read the poem, but also how unimportant his notes are.
On the title-page opposite the words "This Oracle," &amp;c., is written
"written in the temple of Apollo, letters commendatory." On <i>verso</i> of
the title-page, is this memorandum by a former owner: "This Edition
is extremely scarce. Vide Smith's Catgue. Iron Bridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> 1822. Pr. O.
16. O. This Book came out of Mr. Hacket's Library, a Descendant of Bp.
Hacket, whose Book it was, and the MS. notes are by him." The book is
now in the library of my excellent fellow-collector, G. W. Napier,
Esq., of Merchiston House, Alderley Edge, Manchester, to whom I owe its
re-use, as well as of other early editions of Davies. G.</p>

<p class="ph3">REMARKS PREFIXED TO NAHUM TATE'S EDITION (1697) OF 'NOSCE TEIPSUM.'<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
</p>

<p>There is a natural love and fondness in Englishmen for whatever was
done in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. We look upon her time as our
golden age; and the great men who lived in it, as our chiefest heroes
of virtue, and greatest examples of wisdom, courage, integrity and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>learning.</p>

<p>Among many others, the author of this poem merits a lasting honour;
for, as he was a most eloquent lawyer, so, in the composition of this
piece, we admire him for a good poet and exact philosopher. 'Tis not
rhyming that makes a poet, but the true and impartial representing
of virtue and vice, so as to instruct mankind in matters of greatest
importance. And this observation has been made of our countrymen, That
Sir John Suckling wrote in the most courtly and gentleman-like style;
Waller in the most sweet and flowing numbers; Denham with the most
accurate judgment and correctness; Cowley with pleasing softness and
plenty of imagination: none ever uttered more divine thought than Mr.
Herbert; none more philosophical than Sir John Davies. His thoughts are
moulded into easy and significant words; his rhymes never mislead the
sense, but are led and governed by it: so that in reading such useful
performances, the wit of mankind may be refined from its dross, their
memories furnished with the best notions, their judgments strengthened,
and their conceptions enlarged: by which means the mind will be raised
to the most perfect ideas it is capable of in this degenerate state.</p>

<p>But as others have laboured to carry out our thoughts, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>entertain them with all manner of delights abroad; 'tis the peculiar
character of this author, that he has taught us (with Antoninus) to
meditate upon ourselves; that he has disclosed to us greater secrets
at home; self-reflection being the only way to valuable and true
knowledge, which consists in that rare science of a man's self, which
the moral philosopher loses in a crowd of definitions, divisions and
distinctions: the historian cannot find it among all his musty records,
being far better acquainted with the transactions of a thousand years
past, than with the present age, or with himself: the writer of fables
and romances wanders from it, in following the delusions of a wild
fancy, chimeras and fictions that do not only exceed the works, but
also the possibility of Nature. Whereas the resemblance of truth is
the utmost limits of poetical liberty, which our author has very
religiously observed; for he has not only placed and connected together
the most amiable images of all those powers that are in our souls, but
he has furnished and squared his matter like a true philosopher; that
is, he has made both body and soul, colour and shadow of his poem, out
of the storehouse of his own mind, which gives the whole work a real
and natural beauty; when that which is borrowed out of books, (the
boxes of counterfeit complexion) shews well or ill, as it has more or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>less likeness to the natural. But our author is beholding to none but
himself; and by knowing himself thoroughly, he has arrived to know
much; which appears in his admirable variety of well-chosen metaphors
and similitudes that cannot be found within the compass of a narrow
knowledge. For this reason the poem, on account of its intrinsic worth,
would be as lasting as the Iliad or the Æneid, if the language 'tis
wrote in were as immutable as that of the Greeks and Romans.</p>


<p>Now it would be of great benefit to the beaus of our age to carry this
glass in their pocket, whereby they might learn to think rather than
dress well. It would be of use also to the wits and virtuosoes to carry
this antidote against the poison they have sucked in from Lucretius
or Hobbes. This would acquaint them with some principles of religion;
for in old times the poets were the divines, and exercised a kind of
spiritual authority amongst the people. Verse in those days was the
sacred style, the style of Oracles and Lawes. The vows and thanks of
the people were recommended to their gods in songs and hymns. Why may
they not retain this priviledge? for if prose should contend with
verse, it would be upon unequal terms, and (as it were) on foot against
the wings of Pegasus. With what delight are we touched in hearing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>stories of Hercules, Achilles, Cyrus, and Æneas? Because in their
characters we have wisdom, honour, fortitude and justice, set before
our eyes. It was Plato's opinion, that if a man could see virtue, he
would be strangely enamoured on her person. Which is the reason why
Horace and Virgil have continued so long in reputation, because they
have drawn her in all the charms of poetry. No man is so senseless
of rational impressions, as not to be wonderfully affected with the
pastorals of the ancients, when under the stories of wolves and sheep,
they describe the misery of people under hard masters, and their
happiness under good. So the bitter and wholesome Iambick was wont to
make villainy blush; the Satire invited men to laugh at folly; the
Comedian chastised the common errors of life; and the Tragedian made
kings afraid to be tyrants, and tyrants to be their own tormentors.</p>

<p>Wherefore, as Sir Philip Sidney said of Chaucer, that he knew not which
he should most wonder at, either that he in his dark time should see
so distinctly, or that we in this clear age should go so stumblingly
after him; so may we marvel at and bewail the low condition of poetry
now, when in our Plays scarce any one rule of decorum is observed, but
in the space of two hours and a half we pass through all the fits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>Bedlam; in one scene we are all in mirth, in the next we are all in
sadness; whilst even the most laboured parts are starved for want of
thought; a confused heap of words, and empty sound of rhyme.</p>

<p>This very consideration should advance the esteem of the following
poem, wherein are represented the various movements of the mind; at
which we are as much transported as with the most excellent scenes of
passion in Shakespear, or Fletcher: for in this, as in a mirror (that
will not flatter) we see how the soul arbitrates in the understanding
upon the various reports of sense, and all the changes of imagination:
how compliant the will is to her dictates, and obeys her as a queen
does her king: at the same time acknowledging a subjection, and yet
retaining a majesty: how the passions move at her command, like a
well-disciplined army; from which regular composure of the faculties,
all operating in their proper time and place, there arises a
complacency upon the whole soul, that infinitely transcends all other
pleasures.</p>

<p>What deep philosophy is this! to discover the process of God's art
in fashioning the soul of man after His own image; by remarking how
one part moves another, and how those motions are varied by several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>positions of each part, from the first springs and plummets, to the
very hand that points out the visible and last effects. What eloquence
and force of wit to convey these profound speculations in the easiest
language, expressed in words so vulgarly received, that they are
understood by the meanest capacities.</p>

<p>For the poet takes care in every line to satisfy the understandings of
mankind: he follows step by step the workings of the mind, from the
first strokes of sense, then of fancy, afterwards of judgment, into
the principles both of natural and supernatural motives: hereby the
soul is made intelligible, which comprehends all things besides; the
boundless tracks of sea and land, and the vaster spaces of heaven; that
vital principle of action, which has always been busied in enquiries
abroad, is now made known to itself; insomuch that we may find out what
we ourselves are, from whence we came, and whither we must go; we may
perceive what noble guests those are, which we lodge in our bosoms,
which are nearer to us than all other things, and yet nothing further
from our acquaintance.</p>

<p>But here all the labyrinths and windings of the human frame are laid
open: 'tis seen by what pullies and wheels the work is carried on, as
plainly as if a window were opened in the breast: for it is the work
of God alone to create a mind. The next to this is to shew how its
operations are performed.

<h2>II. HYMNES OF ASTRÆA.</h2>


<p class="center">The following is the original title-page of 'Astr&oelig;a':<br /><br />
  HYMNES OF<br />
  ASTR&OElig;A, IN<br />
  Acrosticke verse<br /><br />

  London<br />
  Printed for J. S.<br />
  1599<br /><br />

  [4o pp. 27: register A. B. C. D. of 4 leaves each.]</p>


<p>Throughout, the Poet spells 'Astr&oelig;a': probably Asteria ('&#913;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#945;) were more accurate. Our text for these 'Hymnes' is, as in
Nosce Teipsum, the edition of 1622: but throughout, compared with the
first, as <i>supra</i>. Title-page in 1622 edition is as follows:</p>


  <p class="center">HYMNES<br /><br />
  of<br /><br />
  ASTREA<br /><br />

  <i>In Acrosticke Verse.</i><br /><br />

  London<br />
  Printed by A. M. for <i>Richard Hawkins</i>.<br />
  1622. [8vo.]</p>


<p>With reference to Elizabeth who is so glorified in these 'Hymnes' as
'Astræa,' cf. the 'Conference between a Gentleman-Usher and a Post' in
our Memorial-Intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>duction. I have since found that another copy of
this interesting MS. is preserved among the Harleian MSS.: No. cclxxxvi
fol. 248. I would here call attention to the correspondence between the
metaphor of the Senses serving the Intellect in 'Nosce Teipsum' and in
the 'Conference' as flatteringly descriptive of the position held by
her 'ministers' to the Queen. In Davison's 'Rhapsody' <i>the</i> name for
Elizabeth is Astræa. G.</p>

<p class="ph3">NOTE.</p>


<p>In the Registers of the Stationer's Company, under date 25th June,
1594, a Mr. Harrison entered for copy-right of 'Orchestra' (Notes
and Queries 3 S. <span class="smcap">II.</span>, p. 461: Dec. 13, '62): but it was not
published till 1596. The following is the original title-page:</p>


  <p class="center">ORCHESTRA<br /><br />

  OR<br /><br />

  A POEME ON DAUNCING<br /><br />

  Iudicially prooving the<br />
  true observation of time and<br />
  measure, in the Authenticall<br />

  AT LONDON:<br /><br />

  Printed by J. Robarts<br />
  for N. Ling.<br /><br />

  1596.<br /><br />

[18mo: pp 46: register A B C of 8 leaves each.]</p>




<p>In the Bodleian copy there is this inscription at top of title-page "Ex
dono Wilti. Burdett, amici sui primo die Decembr. 1596 36. E. R."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of the after-dedication 'To the Prince' there was the 'Sonnet'
to Martin which we have placed before it. The title-page from the
edition of 1622 may be added here:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
  ORCHESTRA.<br /><br />

  OR<br /><br />

  A Poeme expressing the An-<br />
  <i>tiquitie and Excellencie</i><br />
  OF DAVNCING.<br /><br />

  In a Dialogue betweene <i>Penelope</i><br />
  and one of her Wooers.<br /><br />

  <i>Not Finished.</i><br /><br />

  LONDON.<br /><br />

  Printed by A. M. for Richard Hawkins.<br /><br />

  1622. [8vo.]
</p>

<p>With reference to 'Not finished' placed on the later title-page (1622),
it is explained by the stanzas restored from the first edition. These
shew that the Poet had intended to pursue his subject further; even the
hitherto omitted stanzas reading more like a fresh 'invocation' than a
'conclusion.'</p>

<p>Our text, as with 'Nosce Teipsum,' is from the edition of 1622: but
compared throughout with above very rare, if not unique, first edition
from the Bodleian. At close, by recurrence to the original edition
we are able to supply the blanks of all the subsequent editions and
reprints. See our Memorial-Introduction, for explanation of the
omission: and for Sir John Harington's 'Epigram' on 'Orchestra.' G.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> See Vol. I., pp. 9-11. The date 1592, sometimes
(modernly) appended to the dedication of "Nosce Teipsum," has
no authority, and is in contradiction with all the known facts
and circumstances. Equally erroneous and misleading is the
ultra-rhetorically given chronology in "Court and Society from
Elizabeth to Anne," (2 Vols., 8vo., 1864), which bears the name of
the present Duke of Manchester, as thus:&mdash;"This Templar ... who wrote
a noble work on the immortality of the soul in the very hey-day of
his young blood, who afterwards became famous for his gravity as a
judge, his wisdom as a politician, and his soundness as a statesman,
terminated his literary career as the author of a poem in praise of
dancing," (Vol. I., p. 289). This is precisely the reverse of the fact.
In his earlier hot-blooded days he threw off his gay and self-named
"light" verses. In an interval of penitent self-inspection and worthier
aspiration, he wrote "Nosce Teipsum," and he followed this up by
ever-deepened grave, wise and weighty (prose) books. It is a pity
(perhaps) to spoil your brilliant bits of antithetic scandal; and more
pity that they should be hazarded for inevitable spoiling. Or put it in
another way: it is too bad to have your cook serving up the Roast Beef
of Old England as if it were strawberries (and cream). One need not use
severer terms, knowing the ducal editorship is a blind. Campbell in his
"Specimens," preceded in the blundering.</p></div>

the Lines to the Lord Chancellor on the death of his "second wife"
(Vol. I. pp. 112-3) it may be noted that he married (1) Elizabeth,
d. of Thomas Ravenscroft of Bretton, co. Flint, Esq., (2) Elizabeth,
sister of Sir George More of Loseley co. Surrey, Kt., and widow of
Sir John Wolley of Pirford, Surrey, Kt., and before him of Richard
Polsted, Esq., of Aldbury, co. Surrey. Her second husband Sir John
Wolley (sometimes spelled Wooley) died in February or March 1595-6 and
was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral. She appears to have remarried (viz.
the Lord Chancellor) in the same year: so that she did not live long
thereafter; for she died on 20th January 1599-1600 and was buried with
her second husband. The Lord Chancellor was in profound grief (as the
Lines of Davies confirm); but he got over it sufficiently to marry (3)
Alice, d. of Sir John Spencer of Althorpe co. Northampton, Kt., and
widow of Ferdinando, 5th Earl of Derby, on 21st October of the same
year (1599-1600) exactly nine months after the death of his (lamented)
second wife. She survived the Lord Chancellor until 26th January 1636-7
and was buried at Harefield, co. Middlesex. Of Ellesmere himself these
<i>data</i> may be given: Sir Thomas Egerton was created Lord Ellesmere 21
July 1603, upon his appointment as Lord High Chancellor of England.
He was further created Viscount Brackley 7th Nov. 1616, and was about
being made Earl of Bridgewater when he died 15th March 1616-7. His son
John was so created 27th May 1617.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> As for much more I am indebted to Dr. Brinsley Nicholson
(as before) for most of the details of the above statement. He has
likewise favoured me with these additional illustrations of a refrain
in the introduction to the "Lottery." In the Queen's Entertainment at
Cawdray (Lord Montacute's), in 1591, an angler says, "Madame, it is an
olde saying, There is no fishing to the sea nor service to the King:
but it holdes when the sea is calme and the King vertuous" (Nichols'
Progresses). Greene also uses it in his James IV., when the schemer who
has gained by flattering the King, says (I. 2)
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now may I say as many often sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fishing to the sea nor service to a King."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
See Note to the "Lottery," Vol. II., p. 88. It was surely an error
of judgment of the late Mr. John Bruce, in reproducing Manningham's
"Diary," to leave out the "Lottery," and related entries, on the weak
plea that the former had been printed in Shakespeare and Percy Society
publications. It may be here mentioned that Manningham, in giving some
of the "Lottery" verses, writes on a leaf which is followed by one of
the date of 1601; but as Mr. Collier remarks, either the leaves of
the Diary got misplaced, or else he was in the habit of using up at
after times leaves that he had left blank. Further: Chamberlain, in
a letter of October 2, 1602, mentions the visit to the Lord Keeper's
at Harefield as part of the late "Progress." The original M.S. of the
Entertainment belonged to Sir Roger Newdegate, but is now missing.
Finally: I over-looked to annotate <i>in loco</i> in the "Entertainment"
itself, that as the Dairy house was to the left while the "House" (of
Harefield) was to the right, the Dairymaid ridicules the idea of the
Bailiff taking such a party to what she calls a Pigeon house for its
size, and which was moreover at that moment in the carpenters' hands.
In effect the Queen had to be separated from at least the greater part
of her suite.</p></div>
